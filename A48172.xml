            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have, (according to your deſire) been at the pains to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe the Diſcourſe of Mr. <hi>Newte,</hi> which he delivered a while ſince to his Auditory at <hi>Tiverton,</hi> occaſioned by the erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an <hi>Organ</hi> in the Publick Temple there. Had he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined his beloved Muſick to his own Pariſh, I believe he might have ſat down quietly, and have ſolaced himſelf with his Harmonious Pipes, without fear of a Contradiction: But he was ſo raviſhed with his <hi>Organical Devotion,</hi> that nothing leſs would content him, than to fill the whole Nation with a noiſe of it. Therefore out comes his Sermon in Print, to tell the World what a mighty admirer he is of <hi>Instrumental Muſick</hi> in the Worſhip of God; with what <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>raiſed</hi> Devotion he adores the Deity; whilſt that of others is <hi>low,</hi> and <hi>inharmonious,</hi> being deadned, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40568:3"/>
flatned by the <hi>hoarſneſs</hi> of the <hi>Wind-pipe.</hi> He diſcovers a mighty Zeal for this ſort of <hi>Church-Muſick,</hi> as he ſtiles it; and therefore has thought fit to oblige the World with a large Sermon to recommend, and defend it. But how grateful ſoever this ſort of Muſick may be to his more <hi>Elevated Genius,</hi> He does ill to blame others for not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it. Why muſt he diſturb his Neighbour with his fancy? Others perhaps do not find this to be ſo great a help to Devotion, as he confidently preſumes it is.</p>
            <p>To render his Diſcourſe the more acceptable to the World. He has Dedicated it to the Right Reverend the <hi>Biſhop of Exon,</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it has met with his Approbation, and Good-liking, I have not heard; but I am ſatisfied that ſome of the <hi>Clergy</hi> look upon it as a mean performance. I perceive, by his Epiſtle Dedicatory, that this <hi>Gentleman</hi> has had a difficult Province of it, in bringing his <hi>Organ</hi> into his Church; He has been attempting it for <hi>Ten Years</hi> together, and could never accompliſh his deſign till of late: And for ought I know at laſt, he has, as the Proverb ſpeaks, made more haſt than good ſpeed. For, <hi>is this a time,</hi> to ſet up Chargeable Organs in the Churches,<note place="margin">This was written when a ſtop was put to Trade by the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the Clipt Money.</note> (the uſe of which he only pretends to be lawful) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vaſt Sums in the ſetting up ſome Muſical Pipes, when as the generality of the Poor complain (and that not without reaſon) that they have ſcarcely Money ſufficient to buy Bread for their Families? <hi>Is this a time to</hi> laviſh a great deal of Treaſure upon <hi>inanimate Organs,</hi> when as the <hi>animate ones,</hi> I mean the Poor, are ready to famiſh for want of their <hi>Daily-bread?</hi> What Harmony can there be in a coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Organ,</hi> when we hear the bitter lamentations of the Needy, and the piercing cryes of helpleſs <hi>Orphans?</hi> Is this a time to regale our Ears with an <hi>Expenſive,</hi> and <hi>yet unneceſſary Muſick,</hi> when we can ſcarcely find Money ſufficient to defray the Charges of <hi>a neceſſary War</hi> againſt a Potent Prince, and Inveterate Enemy abroad? Why muſt it juſt at this very time be Erected? I hope the Worſhip of God has heretofore been managed with as much Edification with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it</p>
            <p>Well, ſeeing he has obtained his deſire in having mounted his <hi>Organ</hi> to the place he deſigned it for, I wiſh it may inſpire him, as with Devotion to his God, ſo with Charity towards his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>But ſome Mens Charity is not very large at home, and then uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally much leſs abroad. His many little ſpiteful reflections he makes upon Proteſtant Diſſenters, diſcover his Charity abroad to be very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive; And whether the compliment he makes his <hi>Right Reverend Dioceſan,</hi> does not ſavour of a want of ſome degree of Charity towards thoſe of his own way, and Church, I leave to you to determine. I ſhall tranſcribe the Paſſage which I have a reſpect to; for I think
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40568:3"/>
it deſerves an Animadverſion. Thus then he Addreſſes his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi>

                  <p>It is now highly to be wiſhed (if ſuch a Wiſh be not too great in our days) that all others, who poſſeſs the ſame Station, and Dignity in our Church with you, were as Zealous, and hearty in promoting the intereſt, and defending the rights of its Conſtitution. It would make ſome of us happy, beyond our expectation, and others beyond their deſign, if not againſt their wills. Then we might ſee our excellent establiſhment, and <hi>Old-England</hi> flouriſh in our time, as they did in that of our Forefathers.</p>

            <p>In which Paſſage, you cannot but obſerve, what a vaſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation he heaps upon his <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> and advances him far above thoſe of the ſame ſtation in the Church. This <hi>Gentleman,</hi> when he drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped this paſſage, I ſuppoſe had almoſt forgotten the common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb. <hi>Viz. That compariſons are odious.</hi> He hereby tacitely accuſes the other Reverend <hi>Biſhops of a want of Zeal, and heartineſs in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the intereſt, and defending the rights of the Churches Conſtitution.</hi> I wiſh this <hi>Gentleman</hi> would be pleaſed to ſhew us, in what reſpects the other <hi>Reverend Biſhops</hi> have been wanting to the Churches Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; For my part I would not in the leaſt be thought to detract from the due praiſes of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Exon.</hi> But why ſhould many other <hi>Reverend Biſhops</hi> of the ſame Order be marked out, as Men too little concerned for the Churches intereſt? When as it is apparent beyond a poſſibility of a denyal, that they have appeared with a great deal of Warmth in defence of that Church, and its rights? That Man muſt needs be a great Stranger to the other <hi>Reverend Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> who ſhall adventure to aſſert, that they have been wanting as to <hi>their Zeal, and heartineſs in the promoting of the Churches Intereſt, and defending of the Rights of the Churches conſtitution.</hi> The preſent <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> has written with great Learning and Zeal, againſt <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> in his <hi>Examination of</hi> Hobbs's <hi>Creed;</hi> and againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in his Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> The Reverend <hi>Biſhop of Worceſter</hi> has Learnedly pleaded the Cauſe of Chriſtianity againſt <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts,</hi> in his <hi>Origines Sacrae;</hi> and <hi>his Letter to a Deiſt.</hi> With very great ſtrength of Reaſon has he Confuted the Doctrines of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> in his <hi>Rational Account, His Idolatry of the Church of Rome,</hi> and in many other Excellent Diſcourſes; And with wonderful Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing has he Vindicated the grand Doctrines of our Religion againſt <hi>Crellius,</hi> and others of the <hi>Socinian</hi> party. His Diſcourſe of the <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt,</hi> and that of the <hi>Trinity</hi> evidently prove this. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I need not tell you, that with great briskneſs he has written againſt thoſe too, who are ſomewhat averſe to the Churches diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40568:4"/>
His <hi>Miſchief of Separation</hi> will diſcover that. I might here recount what has been done by many others of the ſame Order in the Church; as by the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Sarum,</hi> of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and <hi>Ely,</hi> &amp;c. Who have frequently drawn their Pens againſt the Churches Enemies, and upon all occaſions have diſcovered a mighty Zeal for the <hi>promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Churches Intereſt.</hi> And therefore, I muſt profeſs to you, that I cannot but wonder, what ſhould induce this <hi>Gentleman</hi> to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, that the generality of the <hi>Reverend Biſhops</hi> (moſt of whom have been advanced to their Eccleſiaſtical Dignities by his preſent Majeſty King <hi>William</hi>) are not ſo <hi>Zealous, and hearty in promoting of the Churches Intereſt,</hi> as they ought to be. What is it, becauſe they dance not after his Pipe? Or becauſe they do not conſtrain all Pariſhes within their Juriſdiction to erect <hi>Organs</hi> in their Churches? Is this the ground of ſo uncharitable an Accuſation as he has advanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them? A mighty Reaſon for ſo great an Outcry! I preſume the Churches <hi>Intereſt</hi> does not lie in a few <hi>Organ-pipes?</hi> The Church may be ſafe, and in a flouriſhing ſtate without them.</p>
            <p>Really, Sir, what ever this Perſon talks of his <hi>Temper being changed for the better,</hi> I am tempted, from this Paſſage to believe, that his New-Muſick has had very little, if any good Influence upon him. He ſaith little that ſpeaks his <hi>Charity,</hi> but enough to induce Perſons to ſuſpect that a ſort of <hi>Leven</hi> has wrought deep into his <hi>Craſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He talks of making ſome Perſons <hi>happy againſt their wills,</hi> but what he means by it, I do not well underſtand; unleſs he intends that he would have them compelled by ſevere corporal, and pecuniary Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, to be Auditors to his raviſhing Temple-Muſick.</p>
            <p>But adds he; <hi>Then we might ſee our Excellent Eſtabliſhment, and</hi> Old-England <hi>flouriſh in our time, as they did in that of our Forefathers.</hi> But does not <hi>Old-England,</hi> and the <hi>National Eſtabliſhment</hi> flouriſh as much now as heretofore? Did <hi>Old England</hi> flouriſh more in the late Reigns? I wiſh our <hi>Author</hi> would ſhew us in what reſpects it did ſo. Are not Subjects as ſecure in their Properties, as formerly? Is not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as gentle and eaſy, as in the days of our Forefathers? Has not the Church all its Dignities, Honours, and Profits which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ſhe injoyed? May not the Members of the Church be as holy as they pleaſe? And they who wait at the Altar live as piouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſoberly; and Preach as painfully, as ere did any, in the days of our Predeceſſors? Are our Governours ſecret Friends to King <hi>Lewis</hi> and his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> as ſome have been in times not yet totally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten? Really, Sir, I doubt this Man's Muſick hath rather ſtirred his Spleen, or his Gall, than cheared, and ſweetned his Spirits. But now, according to your deſire, I ſhall give you my thoughts of his <hi>Sermon.</hi>

               </opener>
               <p>I perceive that Mr. <hi>Newte</hi> was enforced to have recourſe to the Old Teſtament for a Text, that his <hi>Sermon</hi> might keep Tune with his <hi>Organ.</hi> He was well aware that the New-Teſtament would not afford him one, to anſwer his Deſign.</p>
               <p>Having laid down his Text. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 150.4. and made ſome prefatory Diſcourſe about <hi>Davids compoſing of Pſalms, and ſending them to the Prefect of the Choir to fit, and prepare them to ſome Muſical Inſtrument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then, to make way for the recommending of the uſe of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſick as lawful in the Worſhip of God; He ſingles out the Inſtance of <hi>Saul</hi> to ſhew the mighty power of Muſick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When</hi> Saul <hi>was poſſeſſed with the Evil Spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.23.</note> 
                  <hi>the Royal Prophet having notice of it, took an Harp, and played with his hand,</hi> ſo the latter part of the Verſe ſaith, Saul <hi>was refreſhed, and was well, and the Evil Spirit departed from him.</hi> So that our Author preſumes that a ſeaſonable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Muſick was the proper cure of that Melancholy <hi>Saul</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured under, and which was heightned by the <hi>Devil</hi> into diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now ſuppoſing all this ſhould be granted, I cannot ſee that he will gain any advantage to his cauſe by it. But, with ſubmiſſion to Wiſer Heads, I conceive that there was ſomewhat <hi>extraordinary</hi> in the Caſe. For it cannot be conceived that Muſick ſhould be of ſo great an efficacy as to drive away the Devil. All that Muſick of its ſelf can do, is only to put a pleaſing Motion upon the Blood and Spirits; But I queſtion not but that <hi>Satan</hi> is altogether as powerful to diſturb the Spirits, as Muſick is to compoſe and allay them. And if God leave him to exert his power, I make no doubt, but he is more able to agitate them diſorderly, than the moſt melodious Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick can be efficacious to reduce them to their due, and proper moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I confeſs, if God pleaſe to make uſe of this kind of Muſick as an Inſtrument to produce ſome great, and notable effects, it ſhall be attended with ſucceſs; But then thoſe effects are not ſo much to be aſcribed to Muſick, as to the <hi>Extraordinary concerns</hi> of God therewith all.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall now addreſs my ſelf to the conſideration of thoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the Author of the Sermon alleadges for the proof of the <hi>Lawfulneſs of the uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick in the Worſhip of God.</hi> Although this <hi>Gentleman</hi> propounds them with an Air of Confidence; yet I am not convinced that they are concluſive. I ſhall attend him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Firſt Argument he thus propounds. <hi>The lawfulneſs of that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not certainly, with any tolerable reaſon be denyed, which all Ages have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and approved of. God's own People of Old made their approaches to the true God in a Religious manner with the ſolemnity of Muſick, as well as the Heathen to their Falſe Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:40568:5"/>But that all Ages have allowed, and approved of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſick in the Worſhip of God, is what our Author cannot prove. He pretends not to give us any inſtance of its have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been uſed in Divine Worſhip till the time of <hi>Miriam;</hi> which was about the Year of the World 2513, according to the computation of ſome, or according to others, <hi>Ann. Mundi.</hi> 2453. So that many Centuries of Years were elapſed, before inſtrumental Muſick was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Honour of being made a means of Worſhipping the Deity. True it is, that according to what our Author obſerves in his Marginal Note, the invention of Inſtrumental Muſick was very early. <hi>Jubal</hi> is recorded as the firſt inventor of the <hi>Harp</hi> and <hi>Organ, Gen.</hi> 4.21. But what is this to the purpoſe? What if the Poſterity of <hi>Wicked Cain</hi> were the early inventors of <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick?</hi> Will this prove it to have been of as early an uſe in the <hi>Worſhip of God?</hi> That it was early invented, we readily own, that its ſacred uſe was as early, we utterly deny. And till this <hi>Gentleman</hi> can prove its ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred uſe to be as early as its invention, we ſhall look upon his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Note, as needleſs, and trifling. And his citation of <hi>Job</hi> 21.12. is altogether as uſeleſs to prove what he has undertaken the defence of. <hi>Job</hi> there ſpeaks of the proſperity which many times attends the Wicked in this life, and therefore, ſaith he, ver. 11. <hi>They ſend forth their little ones like a flock,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>and their children dance,</hi> ver. 12. <hi>They take the Timbrel, and Harp; and rejoyce at the ſound of the Organ.</hi> ver. 13. <hi>They ſpend their days in Mirth, and in a moment go down to the Grave.</hi> An irrefragable Argument this doubtleſs, that <hi>Harps,</hi> and <hi>Timbrels</hi> were of a <hi>Sacred uſe</hi> in the times of <hi>Job.</hi> The Poſterity of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſported away their time in Muſick and Jollity in thoſe days; therefore <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick</hi> was of a very <hi>Early uſe</hi> in Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. A moſt wonderful Conſequence!</p>
               <p>Well, but in the times of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Muſical Inſtruments were made uſe of upon a Religious account by <hi>Miriam</hi> the Propheteſs. For it is ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.20, 21. <hi>And</hi> Miriam <hi>the Propheteſs Siſter of</hi> Aaron <hi>took a Timbrel in her hand, and all the Women went after her with Timbrels, and with dances.</hi> To which Inſtance I have a few things to ſay. As (1.) That I Queſtion not, but that <hi>Miriam</hi> did this as a Propheteſs, by an extraordinary impulſe from Heaven. (2) I obſerve, that Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the Worſhip of God can pretend to as great antiquity as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental Muſick. (3) It is apparent that they were Women who thus played and danced. Theſe things being conſidered, I humbly conceive it will be no eaſie matter for a Perſon to draw an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from this Inſtance to prove, the Lawfulneſs of the uſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental Muſick in the Worſhip of God in the times of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>But then he alledges another Inſtance of the early uſe of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſick in the Worſhipping of God, which was in the time of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40568:5"/>
                  <hi>Samuel,</hi> about the Year of the World 2909, as ſome ſuppoſe. For it is ſaid, 1 Sam. 10.5. <hi>That the company of Prophets came down from the high place with a Pſaltery, and a Tabret, and a Pipe, and a Harp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</hi> Now all this I readily grant. But yet this is no Argument of the Lawfulneſs of the uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick in the Worſhip of God under the Goſpel, as I hope to evince before I conclude this Letter.</p>
               <p>But that our Author may conciliate the greater ſtrength to his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, He tells us, that we <hi>have Inſtances even amongſt the Heathens of their celebrating their devotions with ſolemnity of Inſtrumental Muſick:</hi> Thus he tells us from <hi>Homer, That the Greeks praiſed God with an Harp, the Phrygians with a Drum, the Egyptians with a Timbrel; and the Idol-Worſhip mentioned by the Prophet,</hi> Daniel 3.5. <hi>was performed with all kinds of Muſical Inſtruments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although it be granted him, that the <hi>Heathens</hi> made uſe of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſick in the praiſing of their Gods, yet I humbly conceive, he will not be able to prove it to be a dictate of Nature; It is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Men of great Name, that the <hi>Heathens</hi> took up this way of praiſing their falſe Deities in imitation of the manner of Worſhipping of God amongſt the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> The Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> in his <hi>Orig. Sacr.</hi> p. 161, 162. tells us out of <hi>Strabo;</hi> 
                  <q>That the <hi>Cory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantes</hi> of Old, were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, dancing about with their Cimbals, and Drums, and Arms, and Pipes (as tho' <hi>Bedlam</hi> had been broke looſe amongſt them) which he thinks was by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> taken up in imitation of thoſe inſpired Hymns and Muſick uſed by the Sons of the <hi>Prophets.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>That the <hi>Heathens</hi> borrowed many of their Sacred Rites from the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> I conceive has been abundantly proved by many very Learned Men. <hi>Huetius</hi> in his <hi>Demoſtr. Evangel.</hi> has offered many things for the confirmation of this. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> abſtained from Swines fleſh, ſo did the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> The Prieſts amongſt the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> were cloathed with linnen Garments; the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of <hi>Iſis</hi> aped them in this. Had the <hi>Hebrews</hi> their Shew bread; The <hi>Egyptians</hi> offered Bread to their God <hi>Serapis.</hi> Did the <hi>Hebrews</hi> make uſe of Wine and Oyl at their daily Sacrifice? <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.38, 39. The <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> added Wine and Oyl to their Sacrifices. Did the former make a diſtinction between clean and unclean Beaſts? So did the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> Circumciſed their Males, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did the like. More to this purpoſe you may read. <hi>Huet. Demonſtrat. Evang.</hi> p. 125, 126. and <hi>Witſii Aegyp.</hi> p. 263, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We muſt not haſtily conclude ſome Sacred Rites, and Uſages to have been the dictates of Nature, becauſe they have been practiſed amongſt ſome of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Nations; For many times have they adopted the Rites of Gods poſitive Inſtitution into their own Superſtitious Worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:40568:6"/>But that I may give a full, and fair reply to this firſt Argument, I ſhall reduce it to Form thus.</p>
               <p>That which all Ages have allowed, and approved of in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, is lawful in the Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>But all Ages have approved, and allowed of Inſtrumental Muſick in the Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>Therefore, the uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick in the Worſhip of God is Lawful.</p>
               <p>Now our Author is to prove the Minor propoſition, namely that all Ages have allowed, and approved of Inſtrumental Muſick in the Worſhipping of God. This Propoſition is an univerſal Affirmative. And how does he prove it? Thus. If Gods own People of Old made their approaches to the True God in a religious manner with the ſolemnity of Muſick, as well as the <hi>Heathen</hi> to their falſe Gods; then all Ages have allowed, and approved of Inſtrumental Muſick in the Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>But Gods own People of Old have made their approaches to the True God in a religious manner with the ſolemnity of Muſick, as well as the <hi>Heathen</hi> to their falſe God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo.</hi> All Ages have allowed, and approved of Inſtrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick in the Worſhip of Gods.</p>
               <p>Now would I fain enquire of this Author, whether, when he ſaith, <hi>Gods own People,</hi> he intends Gods People <hi>in all Ages?</hi> If ſo, then he ſuppoſeth what he was obliged to prove, and puts off his Reader with that Old Falacy, called <hi>a begging of the Queſtion;</hi> which ſort of begging uſually diſcovers a poverty of Argument. Or whether, when he ſays, <hi>Gods own People made their approaches to the True God with the ſolemnity of Muſick;</hi> he intends only the <hi>People of God</hi> in ſome <hi>Ages?</hi> If ſo, then his Argument will appear to be extreamly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive. For then he attempts to prove an Univerſal by a particular. And his Argument will be to this purpoſe. The People of God in ſome Ages have approached God with the ſolemnity of Muſick, <hi>ergo,</hi> they have done ſo in all. And I cannot ſee how his Argument can be underſtood in a better ſenſe than this. For the Inſtances he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces only reſpect ſome few Ages, and not all. I own that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in ſome Ages, as well as the <hi>Heathens,</hi> have made their Religious Addreſſes with the Solemnity of Muſick; but this will not warrant any Man to conclude, that it is lawful now in theſe times of the Goſpel to make uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick in the Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>But the more effectally to Convince you of the invalidity of this way of arguing, I ſhall ſhew you how that by the ſame Method of procedure, many things apparently <hi>unlawful</hi> in the Worſhip of God, might be proved <hi>lawful.</hi> And Firſt,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:40568:6"/>1. I ſhall begin with Sacrifices. <hi>Gods own People have made their approaches to the True God with the Solemnity</hi> of Sacrifices. Thus <hi>Abel, Abraham, Job,</hi> &amp;c. And you know that Sacrificing was an eminent part of the Eſtabliſhed Worſhip enjoyned by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> It was a Sacred uſage, much more Ancient than that of <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick.</hi> It commenced even in the days of <hi>Adam.</hi> So did not the uſe of that Muſick our Author pleads for. And farther, that the <hi>Heathens</hi> offered Sacrifices to the honour of their Gods, cannot be queſtioned, <hi>Roſin. Antiq. Rom.</hi> Lib. 3. cap. 33. Many Authorities I could heap up to this purpoſe, if there were need of it. But I cannot think any Man of Letters will demand of me the proof of it. Now this being ſo apparent; will it be warrantable for me to infer, that the uſe of Sacrifices is now <hi>Lawful</hi> in the times of the Goſpel? I doubt not but every Proteſtant will tell me the Argument is in this caſe inconcluſive. And why the ſame Argument ſhould be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in the caſe of Inſtrumental Muſick, I cannot imagine. But,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Religious Dancing was of an early uſe, and that even amongſt God's own People. This was of as early an uſe as Organical Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick. For it is ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.20. <hi>That Miriam, and the women danced,</hi> as well as played <hi>with Timbrels.</hi> Thus <hi>David danced before the Ark,</hi> 2 Sam. 6.14. <hi>And David danced before the Lord with all his might, and</hi> David <hi>was girded with a linnen Ephod.</hi> And Gods People had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Old, <hi>to praiſe him in the dance,</hi> Pſal. 149.3. and Pſal. 150.4. But this was not a practiſe confined to the Church of God, for it was a Sacred Rite amongſt the <hi>Heathens</hi> too. As the Learned <hi>Huetius</hi> aſſures us.<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </l>
               </q>
               <p>Now from all this ſhall we conclude it lawful to ſet up a capring Devotion? I dare ſay, no Man of thought will allow ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to paſs for warrantable. But I do not ſee but that this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as fair for Dancing again, as it is cogent to perſwade the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Inſtrumental Muſick in the Worſhip of God in theſe times
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40568:7"/>
of the Goſpel. I ſee nothing our Author has offered to warrant the uſe of his beloved Muſick, which may not be improved for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of Dancing again into Divine Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) If our Authors way of arguing be allowable, it may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to receive <hi>Circumciſion</hi> again. For was <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick</hi> made uſe of in the Worſhipping of God before the Law was given by <hi>Moſes?</hi> As much may be pleaded in the behalf of <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> for it was uſed as a Sacred Rite, and that long before the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Inſtitutions had their compleat eſtabliſhment. It was of a more Antient uſe, than Inſtrumental Muſick. Even in the time of <hi>Abraham</hi> was it enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Sacred Rite, and practiſed by him. For he was Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed after he had arrived to the Age of Ninety-nine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.24. Again this Rite was enjoyned by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> John 7.22. <hi>Moſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gave unto you Circumciſion, Levit.</hi> 12.3. And if we enquire into the practiſe of the <hi>Heathen Nations,</hi> we ſhall find that <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was likewiſe a Sacred rite amongſt them. For ſaith <hi>Huetius,</hi>

               <p>I would not have our <hi>Author</hi> be too haſty to recommend that to the World, as a <hi>Dictate of Natural Religion,</hi> which has been the early practiſe of Gods People, and the <hi>Heathens</hi> too.

                  <q>The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant practiſes of <hi>Heathens,</hi> in a matter not expreſly commanded by God to them, is no argument, that what they did in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was by the light of Nature.

Did they introduce thoſe muſical Inſtruments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Jewiſh Worſhip upon <hi>their own heads,</hi> without any <hi>ſpecial di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> from <hi>God?</hi> If he thinks they did, let him prove it. If not, but that they did it by ſpecial direction from <hi>God;</hi> Why does he ſay, <hi>As were thought fit by them?</hi> For this imports, as if they were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the inſpired Perſons themſelves, becauſe they judged them fit and convenient; not that they did it in purſuance of a Divine command. It is moſt apparent, that all that <hi>David</hi> did in the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Worſhip of God, he did not by his Civil Authority as a <hi>King,</hi> but according to the command of <hi>God,</hi> as a <hi>Prophet.</hi> For it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 8.14. That <hi>Solomon appointed according to the order of</hi> David <hi>his Father, the courſes of the Prieſts to their ſervice, and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites to their charges, to praiſe, and miniſter before the Prieſts, as the duty
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40568:8"/>
of every day required; for ſo,</hi> ſaith the Text, David <hi>the Man of God commanded.</hi> Thoſe words <hi>[the Man of God]</hi> ſufficiently diſcover in what capacity <hi>David</hi> ordered theſe things; not barely as a <hi>King,</hi> but as a <hi>Man of God,</hi> that is, as one Inſpired by, and excited of God to do it. When <hi>Hezaekiah</hi> reſtored the purity of Gods Worſhip, which his Father <hi>Ahaz</hi> had deſtroyed; it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.25. <hi>That he ſet the Levites in the Houſe of the Lord with Cymbals, with Pſalteries, and with Harps according to the commandment of</hi> David, <hi>and of</hi> Gad <hi>the Kings Seer, and of</hi> Nathan <hi>the Prophet,</hi> For, ſaith the Text, <hi>ſo was Gods Commandment by the Prophets.</hi> They did not appoint the uſe of ſuch Muſical Inſtruments from their own Motion, but from Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible direction. Not becauſe <hi>they thought them fit,</hi> but becauſe God thought them <hi>ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Becauſe <hi>God</hi> ordered theſe inſpired Perſons to appoint <hi>Levites,</hi> and the uſe of Muſical Inſtruments in the Worſhip of God under the <hi>Jewiſh oeconomie.</hi> Will this be a warrant for Perſons to introduce the ſame into the <hi>Goſpel Worſhip</hi> without an order, or commiſſion from Heaven? Becauſe Perſons did this then, purſuant to a Divine command, may Perſons therefore now do it without one? Where is the conſequence of it? Let Mr. <hi>Newte</hi> ſhew us a Command in the Goſpel for the uſe of Organs in Publick Worſhip; let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an order from the God of Heaven in the Caſe, and no doubt but he will ſoon have vaſt multitudes to follow him in the erecting of Organs in their Pariſh Churches. But, I ſuppoſe he will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it to be a commendable way of arguing, to plead for the uſe of a thing as lawful under the Goſpel, becauſe it was made of Old part of the legal Service?</p>
               <p>If he judges ſuch a way of concluding rational, he may introduce moſt of the Jewiſh Rites into the Chriſtian Worſhip, and upon the ſame <hi>Topick</hi> plead for their Lawfulneſs. But I ſhall give a more full Reply to this Argument, when I come to conſider Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the lawfulneſs of Inſtrumental Muſick. For Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the <hi>ſame</hi> Argument, but with <hi>more</hi> ſtrength.</p>

               <p n="1">(1.)

If God had thought fit to have made it

part of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Worſhip, it might have been of excellent uſe to excite the Affections of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Harps and Timbrels, Trumpets, Pſalteries, and Dances were all unqueſtionably uſeful under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſtate, May we therefore allow them a Room in the Goſpel Worſhip? Shall we plead their uſe commendable, and ſo introduce them into Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Aſſemblies? I believe our Author will ſcarcely yield this? Yet, if his Argument hath any Force in it, it will warrant the Introduction of all theſe, as well as of Organ-pipes. <hi>Thoſe Inſtances which are produced from the Old-Teſtament,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi>

               <p n="3">(3.) This will reflect upon the Primitive Chriſtians, as if they had not ſufficiently provided, <hi>for the ſhaking off the dulneſs, and deadneſs of Perſons in the Service of God.</hi> If this Inſtrumental Muſick be of ſo excellent an Uſe now for the <hi>ſhaking off the dulneſs of Chriſtians in the Service of God,</hi> was it not a means altogether as proper in the early Times of Chriſtianity? But yet we cannot find that the Primitive Chriſtians uſed our Authors Celebrated Muſick, and ſo far were they from approving it, as a uſeful means <hi>to ſhake off the dulneſs of Perſons in the Service of God,</hi> that they judged the uſe of it <hi>unlawful</hi> in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping Aſſemblies of Chriſtians, as I ſhall prove, before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Letter.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Whereas with reſpect to Chriſtians, he interrogates, <hi>Do they not need ſome ſuch Helps, and Aſſiſtances to move their Affections, to raiſe their Devotions?</hi> What, as Muſical Inſtruments? I Anſwer, No. For, <hi>Sir,</hi> The Caſe is plainly this. Chriſt Jeſus, who beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood what are the fitteſt means to <hi>move the Affections, and to raiſe the Devotions</hi> of Chriſtians in the <hi>Service of God,</hi> has left no <hi>Order</hi> at all for the <hi>Uſe</hi> of <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick</hi> for the accompliſhing of this end. But he has appointed the <hi>Preaching of the Word, Prayer, the Singing the Praiſes of God with the Voice, and the Administration of the Sacraments to move the Affections, and to raiſe the Devotions of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> And by ſuch an Appointment he has ſufficiently provided to <hi>move the Affections,</hi> and to <hi>ſhake off the dulneſs</hi> of Chriſtian Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. Therefore I do not underſtand how they can have <hi>Need</hi> of the <hi>help</hi> of <hi>Organs.</hi> If Chriſt by his Inſtitutions has <hi>fully,</hi> and <hi>ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently</hi> provided for the ſhaking off the <hi>Dulneſs</hi> of Chriſtians in <hi>the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God,</hi> and the <hi>raiſing of their Devotions;</hi> then are <hi>Muſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments needleſs</hi> in the Caſe. To what purpoſe are they? When as thoſe <hi>Ends</hi> are abundantly <hi>ſecured</hi> by our Lords <hi>Inſtitutions.</hi> If he will ſay, that notwithſtanding all the Sacred <hi>Appointments</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Chriſtians have ſtill <hi>need</hi> of <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick</hi> for the <hi>raiſing of their Devotions,</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:40568:9"/>
then will it follow, that Chriſt by his <hi>Appointments</hi> has not made <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proviſion</hi> for <hi>the raiſing the Devotions</hi> of Chriſtians; which for any Perſon to aſſert, would be to <hi>arraign</hi> the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the great Law-giver of the Church. Hence will it likewiſe follow, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> made better proviſion for the <hi>ſhaking off the dulneſs,</hi> and <hi>raiſing the Affections</hi> of Perſons in the Service of God, than our <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf has done.

               <p>As to what our Author ſaith with reſpect to the <hi>uſe</hi> of <hi>Vocal Muſick</hi> in the <hi>Worſhip of God,</hi> I agree to; namely, that it was practiſed by the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> in the <hi>moſt early times</hi> of Chriſtianity; But whether the Chriſtians of the firſt Ages <hi>uſed</hi> the <hi>Alternate</hi> way of <hi>Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> I am not ſo clear in.

                  <hi>Socrates.</hi> Who ſaith, That <hi>Ignatius was he who first brought the Alternate way of Singing into the Christian Church, having learnt it from a Viſion of Angels.</hi> As to this paſſage of <hi>Socrates</hi> which ſome lay ſo great a ſtreſs upon, I do not ſee any good ground we have to receive it for truth.

               <p>Now that the Praiſing of God with <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick</hi> is a part of <hi>Natural Worſhip,</hi> I ſhall take leave to deny, till I ſee it enforced with better proofs, than any our Author has as yet thought fit to Produce.

               <p n="4">(4.) The reverſe of what our Author has aſſerted, may eaſily be made good from ſome of the Writings of the Primitive Fathers; Namely, That it was their <hi>Choice,</hi> and <hi>not Neceſſity,</hi> which was the cauſe they had no Inſtrumental Muſick in their Sacred Aſſemblies <hi>to raiſe their Devotions,</hi> or to render their <hi>Service the more august.</hi> That this was the effect of their <hi>Choice,</hi> is moſt apparent; for they accounted this ſort of Muſick as peculiar to the Jewiſh <hi>oeconomy,</hi> as ſuted only to the Infant ſtate of the Church, and no way congruous to the Simplicity, and Spirituality of the Goſpel Worſhip. They eſteemed it a part of the Ceremonial Service of the Law, which

was deſigned to ſhadow forth the Spiritual Solemnities of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.

               <p>Sir, Having now preſented you with theſe paſſages of ſome of the <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> pray tell me, whether all this looks as if they had been deſtitute of Inſtrumental Muſick in their Religious Solemnities, only from <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> and not <hi>of Choice,</hi> as our Author pretends? Do they not all concur in this? <hi>Viz.</hi> That <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick</hi> was a part of the <hi>Legal Service,</hi> and belongs not at all to <hi>Chriſtian Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers?</hi> It is evident from what the <hi>Fathers</hi> alledge in the preſent Caſe, that Mr. <hi>Newts Neceſſity,</hi> is a meer <hi>fancy</hi> of his own, deſigned to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his <hi>tottering Hypotheſis.</hi>

He inſinuates,<note place="margin">p. 10. in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</note> That the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians wanted Inſtrumental Muſick to help out, and exalt their Devotions.

I am ſatisfied a Man may aſſert it, without the danger of being caught in a miſtake, that the <hi>Devotion</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> was as <hi>raiſed</hi> and <hi>elevated</hi> without theſe <hi>Muſical Inſtruments,</hi> as this <hi>Gentleman</hi> is, with all the <hi>Melodious noiſe</hi> of his <hi>pompous Organ.</hi> The <hi>Devotion</hi> of the <hi>Ancient Chriſtians</hi> was not ſo dull, and flat as <hi>this Author</hi> would inſinuate it to have been.<note n="*" place="margin">Serious, &amp; compaſſ.

               </p>
               <p>By which he would fain perſwade his Readers, that the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> have given ample <hi>Encomiums</hi> of <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick,</hi> as uſed in Chriſtian Aſſemblies, or as uſeful in Chriſtian Churches. For that muſt our Author mean, or he ſpeaks nothing to the purpoſe. But ſuppoſing you to have peruſed the paſſages I have cited from ſome of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> with reſpect to this ſort of <hi>Muſick,</hi> I will leave it to you to judge, whether it be probable they ſhould give an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comium</hi> of it.

And it is very obſervable in this Author, that the ſtrength of his Arguments rarely equals the boldneſs of his Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In the Margin he refers us to ſome of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as having, in his apprehenſion, ſpoken <hi>great things</hi> in the <hi>commendation</hi> of this ſort of Church-Muſick. He cites a paſſage from<note n="*" place="margin">Epiſt. ad Donat. p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which he conceives may give in ſome evidence to this. But how little is this to his purpoſe? How does he prove that by <hi>Religioſa Mulcedo,</hi> the

                  <hi>Father</hi> intended <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick?</hi> Let any Man read the cloſe of that Epiſtle of St. <hi>Cyprians,</hi> and he will be convinced that he ſpeaks of <hi>Vocal,</hi> and not <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick.</hi> Beſides he ſpeaks of Muſick in Private,<note n="*" place="margin">In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivio ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio.</note> at a ſober Meal, or Banquet. And thus the Learned Dr. <hi>Cave</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Primit. Chriſtian. p. 265.</note> underſtands him. Now becauſe St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> allows of <hi>Vocal Muſick</hi> at a Private Meal, will he thence infer that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the uſe of <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick</hi> in the Worſhip of God in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick? What might not a confident Man be able to prove from the Writings of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> if this way of arguing might be allowed him?</p>
               <p>But then our <hi>Author</hi> ſends us to St. <hi>Baſils Homilies</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. and to St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in <hi>various places,</hi> as <hi>commending,</hi> and <hi>approving Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Muſick</hi> in the Worſhip of God. What others may have done, I cannot tell, but I could never meet with any thing either in St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> or St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> that will any thing countenance what he aſſerts. Had he found any thing conſiderable in theſe <hi>Fathers</hi> for his purpoſe, I make no Queſtion, but we ſhould have had it inſerted in the body of his <hi>Sermon,</hi> or at leaſt he would have graced his <hi>Margin</hi> with it. But when he ſhall think fit to produce any conſiderable Teſtimonies from theſe <hi>Fathers</hi> to prove what he has aſſerted, I think, it will then be time enough, to give a reply to them.</p>
               <p>I have taken no ſmall pains in Conſulting the <hi>Works</hi> of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> to ſee if I could find any thing in the Writings of that <hi>Father,</hi> which might look favourably upon our <hi>Authors</hi> poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And after all the ſearch I have made, I muſt profeſs, that I can find nothing, which will warrant this <hi>Gentleman</hi> to ſay, that St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> gives an <hi>Encomium</hi> of the uſe of <hi>Instrumental Muſick</hi> in the Worſhip of God. Indeed I have met with one paſſage in St. <hi>Austin,</hi> in which he fairly makes the <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick</hi> uſed of old by <hi>David</hi> to have been <hi>Typical,</hi> conſult the Margin<note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>De Civit. Dei.</hi> Lib. 17. cap. 14.

                  </note>. I am ſatisfied that this paſſage ſays more againſt him, than any thing he can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce from that <hi>Father</hi> will make for him. Thus I have conſidered the ſtrength of his Second Argument, and have, I ſuppoſe, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently diſcovered its invalidity.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Now I come to examine his Third Argument, which he takes from the <hi>ſenſe of the Apoſtles in the New-Teſtament,</hi> as he ſpeaks. Could he produce any evidence of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> having recommended, or encouraged the uſe of <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick</hi> in the <hi>Sacred Aſſemblies of Chriſtians,</hi> it would be much to his purpoſe. And the <hi>Cathedrals</hi> would have an admirable <hi>Champion</hi> in him, and the <hi>Singing-Men</hi> would have cauſe to con him thanks in a <hi>grateful and melodious Song.</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:40568:14"/>
But let us attend his Argument. He firſt cites a Text, or two, and then argues from them. The Texts he cites are, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.19. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there recommends the uſe of Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, and Singing, and making melody in our Hearts to the Lord.</hi> And St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Is any Merry? let him ſing Pſalms.</hi> So dull am I, that I ſhould ne're have thought an Argument for the Lawfulneſs of the Uſe of <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick</hi> in the Worſhip of God to have lurkt there. But I ſee, a Man may live, and learn. But how does our <hi>Author</hi> Improve theſe Paſſages to his purpoſe? Why thus. <hi>By which, doubtleſs, they underſtood the Pſalms of</hi> David,<note place="margin">p. 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>which are uſed in the Jewiſh Church; and by Singing of them in both thoſe places, it is to be ſuppoſed, they mean with Inſtruments of Muſick. And to make the Truth of this Obſervation the more Manifeſt to you, it is plain they expreſs themſelves by words, which in the Original</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>and</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>from whence that Instrument called the Pſaltery) ſignifie moſt properly, a ſinging with an Inſtrument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe the Author of the Sermon not a little pleaſed with this Argument; but a few Remarks will ſerve to ſhew the weakneſs of it.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) By way of Conceſſion, I grant that by <hi>Pſalms</hi> in the cited Texts, we are to underſtand the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> which he uſed to Sing to his Harp. The Apoſtles enjoyn <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to ſing thoſe very <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> which heretofore the <hi>Levites</hi> ſung with <hi>muſical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) But then, whereas he adds, that when the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> exhort <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to <hi>Sing Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Hymns,</hi> they meant that they ſhould ſing them with <hi>muſical Inſtruments;</hi> which he ſaith, <hi>is to be ſuppoſed.</hi> I think, there is not the leaſt colour for ſuch a Suppoſition. That the Apoſtles intended no ſuch thing, is I think, very plain. (1.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> had no ſuch <hi>Organical Devotion</hi> amongſt them; which, if it had been their Duty, they could not have want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, notwithſtanding the <hi>Pretence</hi> of <hi>Poverty,</hi> and <hi>Perſecution,</hi> as I have obſerved already. (2.) We find the Primitive Chriſtians declaring againſt this ſort of <hi>Church Muſick,</hi> as only ſuited to the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> when in its <hi>Infancy,</hi> as I have ſhewn from ſome of their <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</hi> (3.) If the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> adviſed the uſe of this ſort of <hi>Church Muſick,</hi> it is ſtrange they would not uſe it themſelves! which that they did, I think, none will affirm. (4.) If this were the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> meaning, it is as ſtrange, that none ſhould have underſtood it, till at leaſt, 600 Years after <hi>Chriſt!</hi> Nay, I think, I may add, not till 1600 Years after <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For that any ever underſtood thoſe Texts cited above, as enjoyning the uſe of <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick</hi> in the <hi>Chriſtian Worſhip, till of late,</hi> let our <hi>Author</hi> prove.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:40568:15"/>(3.) But ſuppoſing (not granting) what this <hi>Author</hi> contends for, to be true; namely, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> are thus to be underſtood, as enjoyning the uſe of <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick</hi> in the <hi>Publick Service of God;</hi> Then does he prove more than he undertook to prove. For then will it follow, <hi>that Inſtrumental Muſick</hi> in the <hi>Worſhip of God</hi> now in the times of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> is not only <hi>Lawful,</hi> but a <hi>Duty.</hi> A Duty to which <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are as much obliged, as they are to that of <hi>Vocal Singing.</hi> And if ſo, then were the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> certainly very faulty for 600 Years together, in living in a conſtant neglect of ſo <hi>plain a Duty.</hi> And well nigh all the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and <hi>People</hi> in the <hi>Pariſh Churches</hi> in this Nation are to be blamed for taking no more notice of ſo <hi>Expreſs Apoſtolical a Precept.</hi> But, I am a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe, that this <hi>Gentleman</hi> himſelf, is not of Opinion, that this <hi>ſort of Muſick</hi> is a <hi>Manifeſt Duty;</hi> Or, if this be his Sentiment, I think he has but few amongſt the <hi>Proteſtant Clergy</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> to keep him Company.</p>
               <p>Well, but he attempts to prove, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> adviſing <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to ſing <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms,</hi> meant with <hi>Muſical Inſtruments:</hi> and this by a Critical remark on the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>Which word,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the Original ſignifies most properly, a ſinging with an Inſtrument.</hi> To which give me leave to ſay a few things: As (1.) Suppoſe it be certain, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> does <hi>moſt properly</hi> import <hi>a ſinging with an Inſtrument,</hi> Muſt it therefore <hi>neceſſarily</hi> be underſtood in that ſenſe here? Is this word never uſed in any other ſenſe? If it be ſometimes uſed in another ſenſe, How does he prove that it is uſed in the <hi>moſt proper ſenſe</hi> by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the places cited? If a Man might be admitted thus to argue in all caſes, How many Texts might he be allowed to diſtort from their true Senſe and Meaning? The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith of himſelf, in conjunction with other <hi>Chriſtians, Phil.</hi> 3.3. <hi>We are the Circumciſion.</hi> What Circumciſion ſignifies in its <hi>most proper ſenſe</hi> all know, muſt we therefore here thus underſtand it, as obliging all Chriſtians to be Circumciſed? (2.) I have ſaid enough already to ſhew that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> meant not this <hi>word</hi> in its <hi>moſt proper ſenſe.</hi> (3.) I humbly conceive, that that Text, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. is a plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of our Authors learned Remark. <hi>Is any merry? let him ſing Pſalms.</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (the word general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed in the New Teſtament for <hi>Worſhip</hi>) ſignifies to pay homage by <hi>kiſſing the hand;</hi> And might he not as wiſely infer from thence,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40568:16"/>
that we are ſtill obliged to pay our external homage the ſame way? But if he look again upon that paſſage of the <hi>Apoſtle James,</hi> he will find this ſlender <hi>Criticiſm</hi> too weak a Foundation for <hi>Organs</hi> to ſtand upon; becauſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> could not reaſonably ſuppoſe all thoſe to have <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of <hi>Muſick</hi> by them, or to be capable of uſing them, whom he there Exhorts to vent their Spiritual Joys by <hi>ſinging of Pſalms.</hi>
                  </q> Of which reply the Biſhop has, that I can find, taken no Notice in his rejoinder.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ser. p. 12.</note>But our <hi>Author</hi> goes on. <hi>Nay it is not to be doubted, but (that they, who took ſo much care for the Regulating, and well Ordering of the Church in after Ages) would have cautioned againſt it, if they thought it impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That the <hi>Apoſtles took care for the Regulating, and well Ordering of the Church in after Ages, is not to be doubted;</hi> but will it thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that they muſt needs have <hi>expreſly</hi> cautioned againſt whatever might be improper in the <hi>Worſhip of God?</hi> What thinks he, <hi>Are Oyl, and Cream, and Spittle</hi> fit to be uſed in <hi>Baptiſm?</hi> Are <hi>Kettle-Drums,</hi> and <hi>Horns</hi> fit to be uſed in the <hi>Praiſing</hi> of God in the Sacred Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Chriſtians? Which things are uſed by the <hi>Papists</hi> ſometimes in their <hi>Publick Devotions.</hi> I will take leave to ſuppoſe for once that our <hi>Author</hi> will ſay theſe things are very improper. And yet we do not find that ever the <hi>Apostles</hi> cautioned againſt them. It is enough that they have in general cautioned againſt a <hi>Pompous, Superstitious,</hi> and <hi>Theatrical Worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) This Argument, if ſuch it may be called, may eaſily be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted upon the <hi>Author of the Sermon;</hi> and may be as well imployed, if not better, againſt <hi>Organs,</hi> than for them. For if <hi>Organs</hi> are of ſo excellent a uſe in the <hi>Worſhip of God;</hi> of ſo great an efficacy to <hi>excite the affections, to exalt the Devotions of Chriſtians, to compoſe their thoughts, to drive away evil ſuggeſtions from their minds,</hi> and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der People more <hi>Reverent</hi> and <hi>Serious</hi> in Sacred Solemnities (all which our Author affirms of them.) It is ſtrange the <hi>Apoſtles (who took ſo much care for the Regulating the Church in after Ages)</hi> ſhould give no Charge to <hi>Chriſtians</hi> about them. They have been careful to inſtruct <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as to Vocal Melody, but as to the uſe of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſick they are totally ſilent. Certainly, had the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> apprehenſions of it been conformable to thoſe of our <hi>Author,</hi> they would not have paſſed it over in ſo abſolute a ſilence. This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I think, recoils upon him to his own diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>But he has recourſe to ſome other places of the New Teſtament, which he preſumes may do good ſervice to the Cauſe he has eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For he tells us, <hi>That Inſtrumental Muſick has an Analogy with the Angelical Songs, and Heavenly Exultations in the Quire of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saints, who are repreſented,</hi> Rev. 14.2. <hi>as Harpers harping with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40568:16"/>
their Harps, and having the Harps of God,</hi> Rev. 15.2. <hi>Which places concern the Publick Worſhip of God in the Church, the Joys of the Saints in Heaven, and in Earth, and the Triumphant Rejoicings of Chriſtians, for the Victory over their Enemies, according to the Judgment of ſome Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors.</hi> In the Margin refering us to <hi>Baxter, Bullinger,</hi> and <hi>Hammond.</hi> But to this a few things, as (1.) The obſcurity of a conſiderable part of the Book of the Revelations, is confeſſedly ſo very great, that an Argument drawn from the Obſcure part of it, cannot be thought to be very ſatisfactory; For if the premiſes are dark, and of an uncertain ſenſe, the concluſion will not eaſily gain Credit. Therefore I think it a weakneſs in any Man to go about to eſtabliſh any Doctrine, or Theological Poſition from any paſſage of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, the ſenſe of which may be very dubious, or uncertain. (2.) But ſaith he, <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick has an Analogy with the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Songs, and Heavenly Exultations in the Quire of the Bleſſed Saints.</hi> I ſuppoſe he means no more, than that it does ſomewhat reſemble the Angelical Songs, and Heavenly Exultations in the Quire of the Bleſſed Saints. Let this be granted him, what would he thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer? What! That <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick</hi> is now Warrantable in the <hi>Chriſtian Worſhip?</hi> I ſee no danger in denying the Conſequence. Becauſe there may be ſome <hi>Analogy,</hi> ſome reſemblance, between the <hi>Angelical Songs,</hi> and <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick,</hi> I cannot think that ſufficient Evidence of the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of ſuch <hi>Muſick</hi> in the Sacred <hi>Aſſemblies of Chriſtians.</hi> The <hi>Joys</hi> at a <hi>Marriage Feaſt</hi> may ſomewhat reſemble the <hi>Joys</hi> of the <hi>Saints above,</hi> and the Sacred Scripture ſometimes reſembles theſe by thoſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.9. is thus by many underſtood.</p>
               <p>Shall we thence conclude, that the Expreſſions of <hi>Joy</hi> at a <hi>Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age Solemnity,</hi> as Dancing, Laughter, and the like are <hi>Warrantable</hi> in the <hi>Solemn Worſhip of God?</hi> Heavens Happineſs (in condeſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our <hi>weak Conceptions</hi>) is frequently decyphred in Scripture by <hi>Compariſons</hi> and <hi>Images,</hi> taken from <hi>Material things</hi> here below; Will that warrant us to Conclude all thoſe things fit preſently to be adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the <hi>Spiritual Worſhip</hi> of <hi>Christians?</hi> I cannot ſuppoſe our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor will own a thing ſo abſurd, and if he doth not, he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs his Argument <hi>inconcluſive.</hi>

Well be it ſo (1.)

underſtood of the <hi>Church Militant</hi> Praiſing God here below; which as he hints, is the Opinion of ſome others; yet I cannot ſee any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he will gain to his cauſe by it. For (1.) You very well know that it is a common thing in Scripture, for matters relating to the New-Teſtament Worſhip, to be dreſſed up in Old-Teſtament Phraſes. The words <hi>Prieſts, Sacrifices, Incenſe,</hi> &amp;c. are a clear proof of this.<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Glaſſ. Philol. Sacr. p. 1348.</note> (2.) But methinks we have a Text in the Book of the Revelations, which fairly diſcovers to us, what we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by Harps in this Prophecy, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.8. It is ſaid, <hi>that the four Beaſts, and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them Harps, and Golden Vials full of Odours, which are the Prayers of the Saints.</hi> Here we have the Worſhip of the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the <hi>Praiſes</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> of the Saints under the Evangelical Adminiſtration adumbrated by <hi>Harps,</hi> and <hi>Viols full of Odours.</hi> What we are to underſtand by thoſe <hi>Vials full of Odours,</hi> is made plain to us in the following words, <hi>Viz.

               </p>
               <p>I could, with as much ſhew of Reaſon, Argue from a place in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> that when <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhall fall, and the pure Worſhip of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall be freed from all <hi>Antichriſtian Superſtitions,</hi> and <hi>Pompous Rites,</hi> that then the uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick in the Worſhip of God ſhall ceaſe too; and be thrown out of the <hi>Churches</hi> with her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>gaudy and needleſs Ceremonies.</hi> For if we look into <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. we have there an account of the Deſtruction of <hi>Babylon.</hi> i. e. of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Anti-Chriſtian Hierarchy,</hi> as the generality of Expoſitors under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it.

               </p>
               <p>Here the Author offers to our Conſideration Two things. (1.) The <hi>Antiquity</hi> of this Church-Muſick. (2.) Its <hi>uſe</hi> in the <hi>Reformed Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The <hi>Antiquity</hi> of Inſtrumental Muſick as uſed in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. He ſaith, <hi>It has certainly been of above a Thouſand Years ſtanding in the Chriſtian Church.</hi> (1.) Suppoſe this be granted him, yet for 600 Years, by our Authors Confeſſion, the Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were Strangers to them. So that in the <hi>pureſt</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> times of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> there were no <hi>Organs</hi> reſounding in their <hi>Temples.</hi> After the four firſt Centuries, many Superſtitions found way into the Chriſtian Churches.

                  <hi>The Life and Spirit of Chriſtianity did viſibly decline apace.</hi> And when the <hi>Spirit, and Life of Chriſtianity declined,</hi> no wonder if <hi>Organs,</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Service,</hi> and many other ſuch <hi>Superſtitious uſages</hi> met with <hi>Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> and <hi>Approbation.</hi> None pretend, as far as I can learn, that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans were uſed in the Publick Worſhip of Chriſtians, till the time of Pope <hi>Vitaliane.</hi> He was the Firſt who recommended the uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick to Chriſtian Aſſemblies.

But then it is ſomewhat <hi>doubtful</hi> whether <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick</hi> had ſo <hi>early an admiſſion</hi> into the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, as our <hi>Author</hi> pretends. But of this I have delivered my thoughts before. (3.) Many Corruptions in Worſhip have been of a Thouſand Years ſtanding in the Chriſtian Church. <hi>Altars, Idolatrous Images, Latin Maſs,</hi> &amp;c. can plead as great <hi>Antiquity</hi> as <hi>Organs.</hi> But I ſuppoſe this is not enough to render the Sacred uſe of theſe things <hi>Warrantable.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Luther,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>approved of this</hi> ſort of Church-Muſick. Did he ſo? If our Author had fairly proved it, I might have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe it. But what Evidence does he give of it? Why truly juſt none at all. He cites us a Paſſage from ſomebody, it is true (for he tells us not whom) who hath written the Life of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> which he imagines may import ſome ſuch thing. The Paſſage, as our Author Tranſlates it, is this, <hi>Luther,</hi> ſpeaking of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Service, that it ought to be in the Mother-Tongue, ſaith, <hi>I rather wiſh, than promiſe it, being not ſufficient for ſo great a work, for it requires both Muſick, and a Spirit,</hi> and then he <hi>Laments the want of Poets to Compoſe, and ſing Godly Songs.</hi> But to this a few things. (1.) I wiſh he had told us where we might have found this paſſage, that we might have arrived to the greater ſatisfaction about it. I have conſulted <hi>Melchior Adam</hi>'s Account of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Life, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find it there. (2.) But ſuppoſing this for Truth, that <hi>Luther</hi> had thus delivered himſelf; I cannot ſee what <hi>Advantage</hi> our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>'s Cauſe will have by it. What if he had ſaid, <hi>That the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Communion Service into the Mother-Tongue required both Muſick and a Spirit?</hi> Muſt it preſently be ſuppoſed that he underſtood it of <hi>Instrumental Muſick?</hi> What! Is there no other ſort of <hi>Muſick</hi> than <hi>Inſtrumental?</hi> Ay, but he <hi>Laments the want of Poets to Compoſe, and ſing Godly Songs.</hi> Admirable proof that he approved of the uſe of <hi>Organs</hi> in the <hi>Publick Worſhip</hi> of Chriſtians. What! cannot a Perſon ſpeak of <hi>Compoſing, and ſinging Godly Songs,</hi> but preſently our <hi>Author</hi> muſt Alarm us with the lowd noiſe of Muſical Inſtruments? If this is all the Proof he can produce to Evidence <hi>Luther</hi>'s Approbation of this ſort of <hi>Church Muſick,</hi> it had been better he had held his peace, and ſaid nothing at all. (3.) But whatever our Author ſuggeſts, I am inclined to believe, that <hi>Luther</hi> ne're <hi>approved</hi> of the uſe of <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſick</hi> in the Worſhip of God under the Goſpel; but rather diſliked it.

In many of their Publick Churches in the time of Divine-Service, you may hear the ſound of <hi>Horns,</hi> of <hi>Vials,</hi> of <hi>Organs,</hi> of <hi>Voices,</hi> &amp;c. Will this prove ſuch a <hi>Medley</hi> of ſounds to be <hi>Lawful</hi> in Chriſtian Aſſemblies?</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) But now let us attend the Evidence he produceth to prove <hi>Calvin,</hi> and his <hi>Followers</hi> to have been Approvers of this ſort of Church-Muſick.<note place="margin">Ser. p. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>So likewiſe</hi> Calvin, ſaith he, <hi>gives his Approbation of it in ſome places, but being a Man of intemperate heat and paſſion, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with himſelf in others. I ſhall only mention one, which is his Comment on</hi> Amos 6.5. <hi>where he highly commends</hi> David, <hi>that whereas being Muſical, and a Lover of Muſick; he might privately have delighted himſelf therewith, when he was now in peace, and eaſe, and paſt all his Dangers; yet he choſe rather Muſical Inſtruments to the Exerciſe of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he might thereby raiſe his mind towards God — And that they ſounding the Praiſes of God in the Temple he might excite both himſelf, and others to the ſtudy of Godlineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three things are very Remarkable in this Diſcourſe of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. (1.) He Aſſerts <hi>boldly,</hi> that <hi>Calvin</hi> approved of Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Muſick. (2.) That hereby he is inconſiſtent with himſelf. (3.) He Attributes this to <hi>Calvins</hi> intemperate <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Paſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) He Aſſerts <hi>boldly,</hi> that <hi>Calvin</hi> approved of Inſtrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick. But how does he prove it? From the before cited paſſage. But alas! What does that paſſage make to our Authors purpoſe? His province is to prove that <hi>Calvin</hi> owned the Lawfulneſs of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſick in the Worſhip of God under the Evangelick Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. But doth the fore-quoted paſſage out of <hi>Calvin</hi> warrant him to make ſuch a Concluſion? No ſuch matter. For <hi>Calvin</hi> only commends <hi>David</hi> for making uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick in his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, and Publick Devotions, according to the Command of God. That is all can be rationally deduced from that Citation. So that becauſe <hi>Calvin</hi> commends and applauds <hi>David</hi> for the uſe of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40568:19"/>
Muſick in Sacred Solemnities under the <hi>Legal oeconomy,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Calvin</hi> Approved of the uſe of this kind of Muſick in the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches.</hi> 'Tis a Conſequence, which will not eaſily gain the Aſſent of Conſidering Perſons. Some things which were commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable as done by <hi>David</hi> then, may not be commendable as done by <hi>Chriſtians</hi> now. Should any one commend <hi>David</hi> for <hi>Dancing</hi> in his Praiſing of God therefore, would it be Logical, or reaſonable thence to infer, that ſuch a Perſon commended the uſe of <hi>Dancing</hi> in the Praiſing of God now? It would be an Intolerable <hi>Non-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Our Author ſaith too, that <hi>Calvin is Inconſistent with himſelf in other places.</hi> That <hi>Calvin</hi> in other places ſpeaks againſt the uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick in the Sacred Aſſemblies of Chriſtians, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be true. For ſaith he, on <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.20. <hi>Muſica Inſtrumenta,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick is to be reckoned in the number of Legal Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which Christ has Aboliſhed by his coming; whereas now we muſt retain a Goſpel Simplicity.</hi> But is this Inconſiſtent with what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers on <hi>Amos</hi> 6.50? No ſuch matter. <hi>Diſtingue Tempora,</hi> Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of the Times, and it will evidently appear that he very well agrees with himſelf. As to the <hi>Legal Diſpenſation,</hi> he approves of Inſtrumental Muſick under it. But under the <hi>Evangelical oeconomy</hi> he diſlikes it, and declares againſt it. Here is nothing of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency; But what our Author has advanced againſt him, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Reaſon. I wonder what poſſeſſed our Author, when he dropped this paſſage, that he ſhould charge <hi>Calvin</hi> with incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency; when as there appears not the leaſt colour for ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation. But ſome Men have ſuch a <hi>Pique</hi> at <hi>Calvin</hi> (whether it is the effect of their ill nature, or Education I cannot ſay) that if they cannot find faults in him, they will make ſome; And then he muſt be charged as inconſiſtent with himſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) But this pretended <hi>Inconſiſtency</hi> he aſcribes to his <hi>Intemperate Heat and Paſſion.</hi> (1.) This is not ſo much like a Chriſtian, at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very turn to be publiſhing of Mens Faults and Infirmities. He might have omitted that bitter Reflection without any detriment to his Cauſe or Argument. The Muſick of an Organ is of excellent uſe to <hi>Calm the Mind, and Allay the Paſſions,</hi> if you will believe our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. Whence I ſuſpect that he was ſomewhat remote from his Charming Organ, when he penned this Paſſage againſt <hi>Calvin,</hi> for it ſmells ſtrong of Paſſion. (2.) <hi>Melchior Adam</hi> in the Life of <hi>Calvin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 109.</note> ſaith, That as to his Temper he was <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Somewhat prone to Anger; But then withal he adds, <hi>The Spirit of God had ſo taught him to Moderate his Paſſion, that he was never heard to drop a Word unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good Man, neither would he be ſoon Angry unleſs when he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the defence of Religion, and had to do with rugged, and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born

Perſons.</hi> His Carriage towards <hi>Luther</hi> was remarkable, his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and Meekneſs conſpicuous, when <hi>Luther</hi> had treated him with ſevere Language. For Reply'd he, <hi>Etiamſi me Diabolum vocarit, eum tamen Inſignum Dei Servum agnoſcam. Tho' he ſhould call me Devil, yet God forbid but that I ſhould account him an Eminent Servant of God.</hi> I very much queſtion whether Mr. <hi>Newte,</hi> with all the ſtock of good nature of which he is poſſeſſed, improved, we muſt ſuppoſe, by the Melody of his Organ, would give a milder Anſwer to a <hi>Diſſenter</hi> who ſhould Aſſault him with hard words. May our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor but equal <hi>Calvin,</hi> notwithſtanding his contempt of him. The Writers of his <hi>Life</hi> aſſure us, that he printed his <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> before he was Twenty five Years Old. Every other Week, he Preached throughout the whole Week. He taught in the Publick Schools three days in a Week.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Melch Adam.</hi> In usâ <hi>Calvin.</hi> p. 74.</note> Every Thurſday he Preſided in the <hi>Presbytery;</hi> every Friday he held a Lecture; He Illuſtrated many of the <hi>Sacred Books</hi> with Learned Comments; ſometimes he was imployed in writing Replies to the Enemies of Religion: At other times he wrote of other neceſſary matters; ſo that perſons may wonder that one Man ſhould be ſufficient for Labours, ſo many and great. Now, ſay I, Let our Author <hi>go,</hi> and <hi>do likewiſe;</hi> this will procure him grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Reputation, than ever he is like to gain from his Organ, or his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the Defence of it. Thus I have, I hope, fetched off <hi>Calvin</hi> from being an Approver of Inſtrumental Muſick in the Sacred Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>But now let us conſider what he ſaith as to the <hi>Followers</hi> of <hi>Calvin. The</hi> Dutch <hi>Churches,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which moſtly follow him, have the uſe of Organs very frequent amongſt them; almoſt in every Church, where the People are of ability to procure them.</hi> (1.) I cannot but take notice of his Gloſs upon his Text, his Marginal Remark with reſpect to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches. <hi>Where all Sects in Religion may meet, and many do.</hi> That there are many Religious Sects in <hi>Holland</hi> cannot be denied. But that all <hi>Sects</hi> are there, perhaps this <hi>Gentleman</hi> may not be ſo eaſily able to prove. We have too many Sects in <hi>England</hi> too: We have <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Socinians, Anabaptiſts, Quakers, Muggletonians, Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Calviniſts, Antinomians, Sabbatarians, Papiſts,</hi> and of late <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphians</hi> amongſt us. I do not ſee that <hi>Dioceſan Prelacy</hi> does effectually ſecure us from theſe Sects. And theſe <hi>Sects may meet in our Churches</hi> if they pleaſe, and <hi>many of them do.</hi> As <hi>Calviniſts, Arminians, Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Antinomians,</hi> and <hi>Deiſts.</hi> I ſuppoſe you will not think it ſtrange, that I aſſert that <hi>Socinians</hi> are to be found in this Authors Church. For it is moſt apparent that the <hi>Racovian Gentlemen,</hi> who have of late alarm'd the <hi>Nation</hi> ſo much with their <hi>Anti-Christian</hi> Pamphlets, are Perſons who have crept out of the <hi>Church,</hi> and not out of the <hi>Conventicle.</hi> (to ſuit my Phraſe to our Authors liking) But I can
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40568:20"/>
tell our Author, where he may find a Chriſtian Nation, freed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, if not quite, from all theſe Sectaries. If he will but ſtep on tother ſide the <hi>Channel,</hi> he will there find that the <hi>French Nimrod</hi> has taken an effectual courſe to root out all Sects, and has <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooned</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s Subjects into <hi>Uniformity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But on ſecond thoughts, I am not of our Authors mind, that <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sects do ſometimes meet in the</hi> Dutch <hi>Churches.</hi> I ſuppoſe he was never Converſant among them to make the Remark. I know ſome who reſided a long while there, and they aſſured me, that in the Publick <hi>Eſtabliſhed Churches</hi> few or none meet, but they who are of the Eſtabliſhed Religion. The <hi>Arminians</hi> have places of their own to meet in; ſo the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the <hi>Mennoniſts,</hi> the <hi>Brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts,</hi> &amp;c. It is rarely, if ever, that they frequent the <hi>Eſtabliſhed Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>But the</hi> Dutch <hi>Churches have the uſe of Organs very frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, almoſt in every Church.</hi> I Anſwer, (1.) By way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, I confeſs it to be thus in moſt of their Churches in their lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Cities; but yet I cannot Aſſent to what our Author adds, <hi>That they are in every Church, where the People are of ability to procure them.</hi> That is really a miſtake of the Author. There is a Publick Church, and a very large one, which has them not in <hi>Leyden,</hi> and it is the caſe of ſome others in other Cities. (2.) Altho' they have Organs in their Churches, yet they pretend not, (as our Author does) that they are to <hi>Exalt their Devotions,</hi> and the more to <hi>Excite their Affections;</hi> but they uſe them to Regulate the Voices of the People, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them in the Tune of the Pſalm they are to ſing. (3.) It alſo deſerves our conſideration, that <hi>Organs</hi> were introduced into the <hi>Dutch Churches</hi> by ſome <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> againſt the Conſent of the <hi>Dutch Miniſters.</hi> For at the <hi>National Synod</hi> held at <hi>Middleburg, Anno</hi> 1581, and in the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Zealand, Anno</hi> 1594. it was Decreed<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> that they would endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> to baniſh Organs and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſick out of their <hi>Temples.</hi> And <hi>Voet</hi> informs us, that it was introduced by ſome <hi>Civil Officer</hi> at firſt, upon his own private Motion, without the conſent of the Eccleſiaſtical Synod. <hi>Ne Conſcio, quidem, aut con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulto Eccleſiaſtico Synedrio,</hi> are his words. Let theſe things be conſidered, and then let his Argument from the <hi>Dutch Churches</hi> carry as much weight with it as it can.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing, what our Author has offered us from the <hi>Dutch Churches</hi> and others, may not be ſufficient to gain the point he aims at; then he returns from whence he ſet out, and aſſures us, <hi>Tho' none of the Reformed Churches abroad, did uſe them at all, It is ſufficient
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40568:21"/>
that ours doth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ser. p. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>to juſtifie their Lawfulneſs, being by far, the beſt part of the Reformation.</hi> I anſwer, (1.) Whereas he ſaith, <hi>it is ſufficient that ours does uſe them, to juſtifie their Lawfulneſs.</hi> I humbly conceive it to be a Miſtake. If a thing be not antecedently Lawful in its ſelf, I do not think the Churches uſing it will render it Lawful. Altho' his <hi>Holineſs</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> may pretend to a <hi>Prerogative</hi> to change things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful into Lawful, yet, I ſuppoſe, the <hi>Church of England,</hi> ne're claimed it. The uſe of <hi>Inſtrumental Muſick</hi> by a Church, is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of its Lawfulneſs, unleſs it be firſt proved that that Church is abſolutely an <hi>Unerring one.</hi> (2.) The <hi>Church of England</hi> makes uſe of the Croſs in Baptiſm, yet it is ſtrongly queſtioned whether it is Lawful, as uſed in this <hi>Church.</hi> (3.) The ſame <hi>Church</hi> Impoſes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rites (which ſhe confeſſeth to be indifferent in themſelves) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its Members, as neceſſary Terms of Communion, without a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with which Perſons however Spotleſs and Holy in their lives, however ſound as to Doctrine, ſhall be debarr'd her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But I am ſatisfied, that the <hi>Practiſe</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi> will not render ſuch an <hi>Impoſition</hi> Lawful. (4.) If we would arrive at Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction about the Lawfulneſs of a thing in the Worſhip of God, with ſubmiſſion, I conceive we are not to enquire whether it be the practiſe of a Church now in being, but what Warrant that Church has for ſuch a Practiſe. (5.) The Cathedral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, it muſt be confeſſed make uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick in the Worſhip of God, and we find it in ſome, and but very few Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Churches amongſt us. But the far greateſt part of the Pariſhes, have nothing of it. Nay, not one of a 100 Pariſhes, parhaps of 500 Enjoy this ſort of Church-Muſick. Therefore he cannot ſay, that all in Communion with the <hi>Church of England</hi> do approve of the uſe of it. I am ſatified that Multitudes do not. And ſhould Perſons attempt to erect an Organ in ſome <hi>Pariſh Churches,</hi> I nothing queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that they would meet with great oppoſition. We find it was a long time ere our Author could bring his <hi>Pariſh</hi> to it. He was no leſs than <hi>Ten Years</hi> in perſwading his Pariſh to approve of this Muſick.<note place="margin">Preface.</note> And now his Organ is where he would have it; I very much queſtion whether all the <hi>Members</hi> of his Congregation are ſatisfied with what their Guide has drawn them to.</p>
               <p>Well, ſo great an Authority, I perceive, has this Mans Church, that if it practiſeth any thing in the Worſhip of God (although all other Reformed Churches diſuſe, and diſallow it) that thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently becomes lawful: which, I ſuppoſe, you will grant me is no ſmall abſurdity. But he obliges us with a Reaſon for the proof of this.<note place="margin">Ser. p. 14.</note> For adds he, <hi>Ours being, by far, the beſt part of the Reformation.</hi> (1.) Suppoſe this be allowed him for certain, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the beſt Reformed Church in the World, yet I am not ſo
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40568:21"/>
acute to perceive how it will thence follow, that this Churches uſe of Organs in Divine Worſhip will juſtifie the Lawfulneſs of them. For the beſt Reformed Church in the World may have ſome flaw in it. (2.) But what does this <hi>Gentleman</hi> mean by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when he Aſſerts it to be the <hi>beſt part of the Reformation?</hi> Does he Exclude all the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> of what ever <hi>Denomination</hi> from his Church? And does he include the Vaſt Multitudes of Debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Profane, Atheiſtical Sotts, who loudly pretend to be ſome of the beſt Members of the <hi>Church of England?</hi> Or doth he Exclude them too? (3.) What does this <hi>Gentleman</hi> mean by his Church's <hi>being the beſt part of the Reformation?</hi> Does he intend that it is beſt as to its <hi>Doctrine,</hi> beſt as to its <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> or beſt as to the <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of its <hi>Members?</hi> If he deſigns it of its <hi>Doctrine;</hi> I think other Churches may pretend to be as well Reformed as his. For the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>French Proteſtant Churches,</hi> of the <hi>Dutch Reformed Churches,</hi> of the <hi>Scotch Church,</hi> and of the <hi>Hungarian Churches,</hi> is much what the ſame with that of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> As to <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> let him prove that the Diſcipline exerciſed in the Church of <hi>England</hi> exceeds that of the <hi>French Proteſtant Churches,</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> &amp;c. That the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> are more Conſpicuous for <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> more Eminent for a <hi>Good Life</hi> than thoſe of Others it is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon our Author to make good, if he ſhall adVenture to Aſſert it. But then he muſt not only prove that this Church is the <hi>beſt part of the Reformation,</hi> but <hi>by far the beſt part.</hi> So that this <hi>Church</hi> of his muſt ſurpaſs all other <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> with a high degree of <hi>Tranſcendency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he will prove the <hi>Church of England to be the beſt part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and by far the beſt part too;</hi> And this from a paſſage of the Learned <hi>Cauſabons.</hi> The Paſſage this.<note place="margin">Ser. p. 14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>If my Judgment does not fail me, the ſincereſt part of the Reformation is in</hi> England, <hi>where together with the ſtudy of Truth, flouriſheth alſo the ſtudy of Antiquity.</hi> (1.) It is obſervable that the Learned <hi>Cauſabon</hi> ſaith, that the ſincereſt part of the Reformation is in <hi>England.</hi> He doth not ſay that the beſt part of the Reformation is to be found in the <hi>Cathedrals</hi> only, or in thoſe few <hi>Pariſhes</hi> where they have Organs in their Churches. Nor doth he ſay, that the ſincereſt part of the Reformation is only to be found in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as a Body diſtinguiſhed by ſome <hi>peculiar Rites, and Old Canons,</hi> from the reſt of the <hi>Proteſtant Churches</hi> in the <hi>Nation.</hi> No, he only ſays, that the ſincereſt part of the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in <hi>England.</hi> (2.) That the <hi>ſtudy of Truth and Antiquity flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes in our Nation,</hi> is undeniable. But then it is as evident, that Forreign Reformed Churches have had many Learned <hi>Divines</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, eminent for the <hi>ſtudy of Truth and Antiquity,</hi> and have at this day. Such in the <hi>French Churches</hi> were <hi>Daille, Blondel, Cloud,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40568:22"/>
ſuch in the <hi>Dutch Churches</hi> were <hi>Salmaſius, Rivet,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p n="1">(1.) Does the <hi>Church of England</hi> retain the Doctrine and Practiſe of the Primitive Church? I rejoice to hear it. Has it thrown off all Corruptions and Errours, which were foiſted into the Church in after-times? Good News. But I wonder then how our Authors Church came to Practiſe upon the <hi>Organ.</hi> For there was no ſuch Muſick in the <hi>Primitive Churches,</hi> as I think, I have proved, for 600 Years there was no ſound of the Organ to be heard in the Chriſtian Aſſemblies. This was foiſted into them in after-times. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, how came kneeling at the Reception of the Lord's-Supper to be uſed in our Church? Whereas it was not Practiſed by the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians.</hi> Nay, <hi>Genuflection</hi> was forbidden, by the Cuſtom of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and the <hi>Canons</hi> of the greateſt <hi>General Councels,</hi> on any Lords day in the Year. And this Cuſtom continued a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years in the Church, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in many of his Books has proved. The <hi>Croſs</hi> in <hi>Baptiſm</hi> as a Dedicating Sign, and as uſed in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> was not found in the Primitive Churches. Bowing at the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> was no Primitive Practiſe. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Power of the Keys by a <hi>Lay-Chancellour</hi> is not a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe found in the <hi>Primitive Church.</hi> The Impoſing of <hi>Miniſters</hi> upon <hi>Pariſhes</hi> againſt the conſent of the People, was no <hi>Primitive Practice.</hi> The Excluding <hi>Parents</hi> from entring their <hi>Children</hi> into the Covenant at Baptiſm, is not to be found the Practiſe of the <hi>Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> A Choir of Singing-Men and Lads was what the <hi>Primitive Churches</hi> were unacquainted with. The Compoſing of a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and impoſing it upon all <hi>Miniſters</hi> to be invariably uſed by them, was no practiſe of the <hi>Primitive Church;</hi> at leaſt for 300 or 400 Years. The making the <hi>Surplice</hi> the condition of a <hi>Miniſters</hi> Exerciſing his Office in Publick, was not found in the early times of Chriſtianity.

I hope our <hi>Author</hi> does not intend ſuch a <hi>Beauty</hi> as this; if he does, he will find the generality of the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> are againſt him; and they will tell him, that Goſpel Worſhip in its <hi>Native Simplicity</hi> is its greateſt <hi>Beauty.</hi> If an External Bravery, if Gaudy Temples, and Glittering Ornaments are the <hi>Beauty</hi> of Worſhip; then they of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion will juſtly pretend to a more Beautiful Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip than his Church can.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Author</hi> continues to applaud his Church, by ſaying:<note place="margin">Ser. p. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>She retains the uſe of the Organ, but not as it were abſolutely neceſſary, or as if the</hi> Eſſence <hi>of the Church did conſiſt in it; or that there could be no Church without it; but only as to its</hi> benè eſſe, <hi>its Flouriſhing eſtate.</hi> An excellent remark this, For (1.) Doubtleſs <hi>the Eſſence of the Church</hi> doth not lie in a few <hi>tweedling Organ-pipes;</hi> it would be wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrange if it ſhould. (2.) But yet the ſame <hi>Organs are neceſſary to its</hi> benè eſſe, <hi>its Flouriſhing eſtate.</hi> So that, altho' the Church may be a Church without them, yet the Church cannot be in a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Condition without them. But how does our Author prove it? What mighty Arguments does he produce for the Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Momentous Aſſertion? Alas! as to that matter, he beggs your Diverſion, and aſſures you that the matter is even ſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have Reaſon to believe him. But I would ask this <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> could I come at him, What! Was not the Church in a <hi>flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing eſtate</hi> in the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great? And yet there were no <hi>Organs</hi> then to <hi>Exalt their Devotions.</hi> Cannot the Church Flouriſh, unleſs the ſound of Organs be heard in every Worſhipping Aſſembly? Suppoſe the Church ſhould have a Learned and Pious Clergy; ſhould have vaſt and numerous Aſſemblies, conſiſting all
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40568:23"/>
of Pious, Peaceable, and Fruitful Members: Suppoſe it ſhould be ſmiled upon by a Religious, and Zealous Magiſtracy, and it ſhould have nothing of Diviſion, or Animoſity to infeſt it; and ſhould have all the Ordinances of Chriſt Adminiſtred in it according to the rule of the Goſpel; would not the Church be in a <hi>Flouriſhing eſtate,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' the Ears of its Members were not regailed with an Organical Melody? With ſubmiſſion to our Author's great Learning and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I humbly conceive it would. (3.) But the Myſtery lies here, ſome <hi>Perſons</hi> are for ſetting up their <hi>Fancies</hi> in their Churches, and the bringing in of their own <hi>Whims</hi> into Divine Worſhip, and then preſently they cry they are neceſſary to the <hi>Flouriſhing estate of the Church;</hi> and that they <hi>Meliorate</hi> the Worſhip of God: As if the Worſhip of God were not as Decent, as Comely, as Flouriſhing without them. Methinks ſuch <hi>Perſons</hi> are juſt like a ſort of <hi>Modiſh Ladies</hi> of our Times; to whom, altho' God has given pretty good Features, and has put a conſiderable Comelineſs upon them; yet will they <hi>Paint,</hi> and <hi>Dawb</hi> their Faces, and beautifie themſelves with their curious <hi>Waſhes,</hi> and artificial <hi>Dyes;</hi> and then they cry it is for the heightning of their Beauty; for the giving an advance to their Comelineſs. But who does not ſee, that this does not augment their Beauty, but hide it: And who would account a Painted <hi>Jezabel</hi> more <hi>Beautiful,</hi> than a comely <hi>Rachel?</hi> (4.) If Organs do render the Church more Flouriſhing and Beautiful, then an addition of Harps, and Pſalteries, and Timbrels, and Dances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would yet give a greater advance to its Beauty, and render it more Pompous and Flouriſhing. Upon the ſame pretence, theſe, and many other ſuch things might be introduced into the Worſhip of God. All the Gay, and Glittering Pomps and Rites of the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> were brought in upon the ſame Foundation.</p>

               <p>But now we are arrived at his <hi>Fifth Argument,</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>5</label> which he takes from the Conceſſion of ſome of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> particularly from the Reverend Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) He begins with Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and alledges his Teſtimony for the Defence of the Lawfulneſs of Inſtrumental Muſick in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. I muſt confeſs I have a very high eſteem of Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and am perſwaded that he has done very great ſervice to the Church of God, by the many excellent Diſcourſes he has publiſhed both in <hi>Practical</hi> and <hi>Polemick Divinity.</hi> But yet, I ſuppoſe it would be a miſtaken Commendation of him, to ſay that he was without all <hi>Miſtake.</hi> As to his judgment reſpecting the uſe of Organs, I cannot cloſe with it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conſider Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Arguments as our <hi>Author</hi> has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded them, and endeavour a Reply to them.</p>
               <p>His Arguments as propounded by Mr. <hi>Newte,</hi> are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>God ſet up Inſtrumental Muſick long after</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Ceremonial Law by</hi> David <hi>and</hi> Solomon. I Anſwer, (1) Inſtrumental Muſick was made uſe of in the Worſhip of God, as I conceive, long before the times of <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Solomon.</hi> Our <hi>Author</hi> has ſaid enough to confute this <hi>Firſt Argument</hi> in producing the Inſtance of <hi>Miriams</hi> praiſing God with <hi>Timbrels.</hi> (2.) <hi>Trumpets</hi> were uſed in the Worſhip of God as enjoyned by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Ceremonial Law: as we read <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>In the day of your gladneſs, and in your ſolemn days, and in the beginnings of your Months, ye ſhall blow with your Trumpets over your Burnt-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and over the Sacrifices of your Peace-offerings, that they may be to you for a Memorial before your God.</hi> The ſame thing was part of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law in <hi>David</hi>'s time, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.3, 4. it is there ſaid, <hi>Blow
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40568:24"/>
up the Trumpet in the New-Moon, in the time appointed, in our ſolemn feaſt day, for this was a Statute for</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and a Law of the God of</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob. So that Inſtrumental Muſick was ſet up by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Law. Therefore, I conceive, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> miſtakes when he ſays, that God ſet up Inſtrumental Muſick <hi>long after</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Ceremonial Law:</hi> If by <hi>ſetting up</hi> he intends the firſt Appointment of this ſort of Muſick in Divine Worſhip. Inſtrumental Muſick was ſet up by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Ceremonial Law, and farther ratified by the Ceremonial Law in the times of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> That it was ſet up by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Ceremonial Law, to me ſeems apparent from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.4, 5. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited; which place the Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> thus Paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>And this is but agreeable to the Ordinances of Divine Service given by God himſelf on Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>for all poſterity most ſtrictly to obſerve.</hi> (3.) The Ceremonial Law was not given all at once, but was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated by degrees. For Sacrifices were inſtituted firſt; Then the eating of Blood was prohibited; Then Circumciſion was enjoined, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then a greater number of Ceremonies were added by <hi>Moſes</hi> at the giving of the Law; and at length the Ceremonial Law had its utmoſt Complement in the time of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Before the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> there was the uſe of Muſical Inſtruments by <hi>Miriam:</hi> Then the uſe of Trumpets enjoined by the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and then a greater number of Muſical Inſtruments were added by <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> (4.) Many things were added to the Ceremonial Law in the times of <hi>Solomon,</hi> as <hi>Candleſticks, Lavers,</hi> &amp;c. But more I ſhall add of this, when I come to conſider Mr. <hi>Newtes</hi> Anſwers to Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>2</label> Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Second Argument to prove the Lawfulneſs of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſick is this. <hi>It is a Natural help to the minds alacrity; and it is a Duty, and not a Sin to uſe the helps of Nature, and lawful Art; tho' not to Inſtitute Sacraments of our own.</hi> I Anſwer, (1.) Let it be ſuppoſed that Inſtrumental Muſick is a <hi>Natural help to the Minds ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity;</hi> yet will it not preſently follow, that it may be admitted to have a room in Divine Worſhip. How many things are there which are <hi>Natural helps to the Minds alacrity;</hi> which yet, I ſuppoſe our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> will not allow may have a Sacred Uſe in the Solemn Aſſemblies of Chriſtians. As (1.) Dancing is thought by many to be a <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Art,</hi> and was uſed by <hi>Miriam</hi> and <hi>David</hi> in Conjunction with their Muſick, and has a tendency to <hi>exhilerate the Mind.</hi> Yet I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this will not warrant the uſe of it in Chriſtian Aſſemblies. (2.) The uſe of ſweet perfumes is a <hi>Natural help</hi> to the <hi>chearing of the Mind,</hi> at leaſt to moſt Perſons. Is it therefore Lawful to bring in the uſe of <hi>Incenſe</hi> again into the Worſhip of God? And to recal that Ceremony of the <hi>Temple?</hi> (3.) A Glaſs of Wine is a <hi>Natural help to the Minds alacrity,</hi> Pſal. 104.15. <hi>Wine that maketh glad the heart
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40568:24"/>
of Man.</hi> But will it thence follow that in the Worſhip of God Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons my drink round? True it is, in one part of Divine Worſhip, we make uſe of Wine, but the Goſpel warrants us to do that. But the Queſtion is, Whether we may make uſe of it in any other part of Worſhip to exhilerate the Spirits, without a Commiſſion? When we can find a Precept in the Goſpel for the uſe of Inſtrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, we will readily rejoice in its Harmony.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Similitude taken from a <hi>Pair of Spectacles, which are comfortable helps in reading the Bible,</hi> methinks does not reach the Caſe. For we being commanded to read the Bible, if our Eyes, (which are the ſenſes as we imploy in the diſcharging that Duty) are weak, we are obliged to make uſe of <hi>Spectacles</hi> or of ſome other <hi>Lawful Art,</hi> to help the ſight, to ſtrengthen the Eye, that it may be enabled to diſcern objects with the greater diſtinctneſs. So, if there is any defect in the Organs imployed in Singing; if there be a Natural debility in them, or ſuch a drineſs as renders the Voice hoarſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I make no queſtion but it may be lawful to make uſe of ſome means to ſtrengthen the Organs, and to remove that hoarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wherewith a Perſon may be infeſted. But alas! Muſical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments are of no efficacy in the Caſe. They cannot clear the Voice; nor will they enable Perſons to ſing with the greater ſtrength or ſweetneſs. For they cannot corroborate the Organs, nor moiſten the <hi>Arteria aſperia.</hi> We are commanded to Sing Pſalms of Praiſe to God; ſo that Chriſtians are obliged to ſing according to the beſt Skill they have. Let Perſons make uſe of Lawful Art, if they will, to better their Voices, and to diſpoſe them to ſing the more ſweetly and melodiouſly. But this will not warrant the Introduction of Inſtrumental Muſick into the Worſhip of God; For that will not render the Voice the more Muſical. Seeing we are commanded to Sing, it will not be amiſs for Perſons to endeavour to gain ſome skill in the Art of Singing, if they can, that they may perform that duty the more decently, and with the leſs diſorder and confuſion. So if God had enjoined us the uſe of Muſical Inſtruments in his Worſhip we ſhould have been under an Obligation to have procured ſuch as would yeild a ſweet ſound; and have endeavoured to have gotten the beſt we could. But becauſe God commands us <hi>Vocal Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> it does not therefore follow, that we may make uſe of <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.</hi>

(1.) If he means that no Scripture does <hi>expreſly</hi> forbid it, and from thence concludes it Lawful; then will it follow, that what ever things the Scripture does not <hi>expreſly</hi> forbid may lawfully be uſed in the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Then Holy-water, Crucifixes, Altars, Oyl, Salt and Cream in Baptiſm may be harmleſsly uſed. For the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do not any where <hi>expreſsly</hi> caution againſt them. Upon this pretence, how many things might be introduced into the Chriſtian Worſhip? And the Chriſtian Worſhip be rendred as Ceremonious as that under the Law. Upon the ſame pretence Perſons might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect a Gallows in the Church to put People in mind of the Juſtice of God: Or Miniſters might be ordered to hold, and brandiſh a naked Sword with their hands during the delivery of their Sermons to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite their Auditory to the greater Reverence, and to mind them, that the <hi>Word of God is the Sword of the Spirit.</hi> Theſe, and Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of the like might be introduced into the Worſhip of God upon the ſame grounds; for the <hi>Scripture forbids them not.</hi> At this door moſt of the Superſtitions, and Dotages of Men in the Worſhip of God have entred. <q>When God has by his Soveraign Order <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Nothing can be ſaid againſt it</hi> (Inſtrumental Muſick) <hi>that I know of, but what is ſaid againſt Tunes, and Melody of Voice.</hi> I Anſwer, (1.) I humbly conceive that a great deal more may be ſaid againſt it. For thus much is certain, that God has enjoyned us Vocal Singing, and commanded us to make Melody in the Praiſing of him. Now Sing we cannot, but we muſt make uſe of ſome Tune or other; Some ſort of Melody or other, muſt be made for the diſcharging this Duty. Now ſeeing God has left us no Direction in what Tune he would have us Sing, it is moſt apparent, that he has left us at liberty as to this Matter. Seeing he has made vocal Singing our Duty by a plain command; he has thereby made <hi>Tune</hi> disjunctively neceſſary. Not that this, or that, <hi>Singly</hi> conſidered, is neceſſary; but ſome <hi>Tune</hi> or other <hi>disjunctively:</hi> And ſo God has left it to Chriſtians themſelves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of the particular <hi>Tunes</hi> they will praiſe God by. But God has not any way Commanded Inſtrumental Muſick; it cannot be reduced to any precept of the Goſpel either <hi>directly</hi> or <hi>disjunctively.</hi> True it is, If God had been pleaſed to have commanded us the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating his Praiſes with Muſical Inſtruments; without ſpecifying what ſort he would have imployed in that caſe; then Perſons would not have been obliged to any particular ſort of them; but they might have uſed either Pſalteries, or Harps, or Viols, or Organs, as they ſhould have found to have been moſt Convenient for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But alas! God has not enjoyned us the uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick at all in Religious Duties, and therefore there is no reaſon Perſons ſhould be ſollicitous about the ſort of them. Well then, <hi>Tune</hi> being <hi>disjunctively</hi> conſidered, falling under a Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and Muſical Inſtruments however conſidered falling under none, I ſuppoſe a Man may ſay, that more may be ſaid for <hi>Tunes,</hi> than for Inſtrumental Muſick in the Worſhip of God under the Goſpel.

I believe we may be able to ſay <hi>a little more</hi> againſt Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Muſick in the Worſhip of God, than can be ſaid againſt <hi>Tunes,</hi> and <hi>Melody</hi> in Vocal Muſick. When we ſhall come to conſider Mr. <hi>Newtes</hi> Anſwers to Objections, I ſuppoſe you may be convinced of this; therefore, thither I refer you.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Having done with Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> next he produces the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines</hi> in this Matter, as he ſaith. His words are theſe. <hi>To this Opinion of</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxters, I ſhall add that of the</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Divines,<note place="margin">Ser. p. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>very different from thoſe of</hi> Geneva <hi>on this laſt Pſalm.</hi> Well! What is it which the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> has delivered, which ſo much ſuits our <hi>Author</hi>'s darling Opinion? <hi>He (ſay they, ſpeaking of</hi> David) <hi>Exhorteth them, that they might praiſe God the better, to ſtir up
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40568:26"/>
their joy with Muſical Instruments.</hi> (1.) I perceive he has a particular <hi>pique</hi> at the Divines of <hi>Geneva.</hi> His Charity for them ſeems to be extreamly cold, if he has any; But we ſhall find him again quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling with <hi>Geneva</hi> e're we come to the end of his Diſcourſe; and therefore we ſhall defer our remarks upon this to the next meeting. But that the Opinion of the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> is different from that of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of <hi>Geneva</hi> in the preſent Caſe, is perhaps more than our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> may be able to prove. (2.) What he has cited from the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies Annotations. I think he does not well to ſtile the <hi>Opinion of the Aſſembly:</hi> For he can never prove that the whole Aſſembly allowed of that as a good Expoſition. True, the paſſage he cites is taken out of a Book, which is Entituled, <hi>The Aſſemblies Annotations.</hi> But it muſt be conſidered, that the Aſſembly did not <hi>conjunctly</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thoſe <hi>Annotations.</hi> For one Man drew up <hi>Annotations</hi> upon one part of the <hi>Bible,</hi> and another took another part for his Province. As Biſhop <hi>Reynolds</hi> compoſed the Annotations upon the <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> and <hi>Canticles, Gataker</hi> wrote Annotations on <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> &amp;c. And who was the Author of the Annotations upon the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> I know not. But whoever was the Author, it will not warrant this <hi>Gentleman</hi> to conclude what ever the <hi>Annotator</hi> has delivered there, to have been the unanimous Opinion of the whole <hi>Aſſembly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) But to be as kind to him as we may, ſuppoſe it ſhould be granted him, that the whole Aſſembly approved of the cited paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; it will not follow that they approved of the uſe of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſick in the Worſhip of God under the Goſpel. For all which that paſſage imports is only thus much, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>David</hi> exhorted the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> People to ſtir up their joys in the praiſing God by Muſical Inſtruments. And what is this to our Authors purpoſe? Do the Aſſembly ſay that <hi>David</hi> gave any Directions concerning the uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick in <hi>Chriſtian Aſſemblies,</hi> which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after were to be? If not, it is nothing as to the point, which he deſigns to gain. I ſee the Aſſembly cannot help him, altho' he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to them; well, therefore he will ſtrive by his own Strength to do ſome notable thing, which may for ever ſilence all his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ser. p. 19.</note>For ſaith he, <hi>And the remark upon it is unanſwerable, if Muſical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments (as is granted) had that power then, how have they changed their Nature ſince?</hi> (1.) And is it only come to this! I expected he ſhould have delivered a plain paſſage from the Aſſembly to prove that it was their concurrent Opinion and Judgment, that Muſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may lawfully be made uſe of by Chriſtian Aſſemblies in their Worſhipping of God. This is what any Reader would have expected upon the peruſal of his preceding Words: But he fobs us off with a little <hi>Remark</hi> upon a Sentence nothing to his Purpoſe. (2.) But his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40568:26"/>
daunting, and <hi>Unanſwerable Remark</hi> it is fit we ſhould attend. This terrible word <hi>Unanſwerable</hi> is enough to ſcare a Junior Diſputant, But perhaps all this <hi>Remark</hi> may be no other than a harmleſs <hi>Mormo,</hi> only to Amuſe, not to do any Execution. Therefore I ſhall look a little more narrowly into it. <hi>If,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Muſical Inſtruments, (as is granted) had that power then, how have they changed their Nature ſince?</hi> A few things will diſcover this Interrogatory not to be ſo very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable as our <hi>Author</hi> preſumes it to be. (1.) Theſe were <hi>Means</hi> appointed of God to ſtir up the Affections of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Legal <hi>oeconomy;</hi> and doubtleſs God concurred with his own Inſtitutions, and made them uſeful to that end. But they are not a <hi>means</hi> now thus appointed of God to be uſed in Goſpel-Churches: Therefore we have no reaſon to expect, that God ſhould thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with Perſons in the Uſe of them, in theſe times of the New-Teſtament Adminiſtration. (2.) At the ſame rate a Man may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue for the uſe of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Incenſe</hi> ſtill: For is it not very eaſie to ſay, if <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and <hi>Incenſe</hi> were of uſe then to ſtir up the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>How have they changed their Nature ſince?</hi> And muſt this be looked upon as an <hi>Unanſwerable Remark?</hi> If not, Why ſhould our Authors be thought to be ſo? But I ſhall offer you a few things more to this purpoſe; when I come to conſider the great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which, as our Author avers, acrue to Perſons by this ſort of Church Muſick.</p>
               <p>Thus having conſidered the <hi>Authority</hi> he has produced from thoſe of the <hi>Separation</hi> (as he ſtiles them) in the behalf of his admired Muſick, I will endeavour to be even with him, by preſenting you with the Judgment of two Church-men directly againſt it.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) I ſhall offer you the Opinion of Mr. <hi>Maxwel</hi> a <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Divine, but yet not of the <hi>Geneva</hi> Cut, but of the true <hi>Prelatical</hi> Stamp. In a Diſcourſe of his, Entituled, <hi>The Excellency of the Church of</hi> England <hi>above that of</hi> Geneva, He delivers himſelf thus. <q>We agree with the <hi>Reformed Divines,</hi> that Inſtrumental Muſick is neither a help to, nor a part of Divine, or Eccleſiaſtick Worſhip.</q> This, I am ſatisfied is a much fuller Paſſage againſt Inſtrumental Muſick in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, than is his citation from the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> Annotations for it.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) But what will you ſay, if I produce a very Eminent and Learned <hi>Biſhop</hi> declaring againſt this ſort of Muſick in Chriſtian Aſſemblies! That, I ſuppoſe, may be ſufficient to counter-poize Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Teſtimony. Well then, the Reverend, the Learned Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> Delivers himſelf expreſly againſt this ſort of Church Muſick; For ſaith he, <hi>The Uſe of Pſalmody, or Singing of Pſalms,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Duct. dub. Lib. 3. p. 329.</note> 
                  <hi>be cauſe it can ſtir up the Affections, and make Religion pleaſe more Faculties, is very apt for the Edification of Churches. The uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40568:27"/>
may alſo add ſome little advantages to Singing; but they are more apt to change Religion into</hi> Air, and Fancies, and <hi>take off ſome of its</hi> Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, <hi>and are not ſo fitted for</hi> Edification. Ad Diſciplinas aliquod Artificiale Organum non eſt ad hibendum, <hi>ſaid</hi> Ariſtotle, <hi>as he is quoted by</hi> Aquinas. <hi>Artificial Inſtruments are not fit to be applied to the Uſe of Diſciplines; that is, The Muſick of Inſtruments does not make a Man wiſer, or inſtruct him in any thing; this is true, and therefore they are not of themſelves very good</hi> Miniſtries <hi>of Religion.</hi> And then a little below in the ſame page, he tells us from <hi>Chryſoſtom, That thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments were permitted the</hi> Jews, ob eorum Imbecilitatem; <hi>For their Weakneſs.</hi> Thus, I ſuppoſe, I have fully requited him for his Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this time, I preſume, you may be ſatisfied, that I have fairly repreſented his Arguments, and as fairly Anſwered them.</p>
               <p>But now the method of his Diſcourſe leads us to conſider the <hi>great Uſe and Advantages</hi> of this ſort of Muſick: For theſe, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, are many. But I am inclined to believe that Inſtrumental Muſick in the Worſhip of God, is nothing ſo uſeful as he imagines. The <hi>Advantages,</hi> which he confidently avers may be reaped by it, may be rather the Suggeſtions of a warm Fancy, than the Reſults of a well informed Judgment But that I may the more exactly ſuit my Anſwers to his Allegations, I ſhall carefully trace him as to the ſteps he takes in order to his Advance to that Poſition, <hi>Viz. That the Uſe of Organs is of very great Advantage in the Worſhip of God in theſe times of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ser. p. 20.</note>The Firſt advantage of Organs he thus expreſſeth. <hi>The Organ will Regulate the Untuneable Voices of the Multitude; and make the Singing in the Church more Orderly and Harmonious. It cannot be ſuppoſed, but there will be great Diſcord, and Jarrings in a mixed company of Singers, where few perhaps have had the Benefit of Art to Tune and help their Voices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) How can the Organ <hi>Regulate untuneable Voices, or make them Harmonious in the Church?</hi> If they are <hi>Untuneable,</hi> or not Tuneable, I am certain they cannot be Harmonious; any more than there can be Harmony in Singing without a Tune. But I ſuppoſe that word was intended rather to make the Sentence <hi>Tuneable,</hi> than <hi>True.</hi> (2) But I believe his meaning to be, that the Organ will <hi>Regulate the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned Voices of the Multitude,</hi> and render them the more Harmonious. To this then I Anſwer, That the Organ may ſometimes drown the Voices of the Multitude, by its lowder noiſe; but I am not in the leaſt ſatisfied, that it will render <hi>Untuned Voices</hi> the more <hi>Harmonious.</hi> For if the Voices are not Harmonious, the Organ will not make them ſo. If there are Jarrings and Diſcords in a mixed Company of Singers, when the Organ does not found; I cannot ſee how the Organ will help them by its Harmony to be more Orderly and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40568:27"/>
Melodious: For Perſons who have not had ſomewhat of <hi>Art</hi> to help their Voices, know not well how to ſing in Conſort with an Organ. (3.) But if Perſons have <hi>untuned Voices,</hi> I ſuppoſe there may be a much better Cure for this, than an Organ. If they are but taught to ſing by ſome Artiſt, their <hi>Voices</hi> will be more <hi>Harmonious,</hi> than an Organ can make them to be. And leſs than <hi>Five hundred Pound Sterling</hi> will be enough to procure an Artiſt or two to Inſtruct a Large Congregation in Vocal Muſick, and to bring them to ſome competent skill in Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mody. The <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants in their Churches ſing very Harmoniouſly, and that becauſe they are inſtructed in the Elements of Vocal Muſick from their Child-hood. For at the ſame time their Children are taught to Read, they are taught to Sing. So that it is not the Melodious ſound of an Organ, that prevents Diſcords and jarrings amongſt them; but their skill in Vocal Muſick; and this Perſons may arrive to by ſome Inſtruction from an Artiſt, much ſooner than by<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>and pleaſe the Offerer.</hi> How well <hi>it may pleaſe the Offerer</hi> I ſhall not enquire; but that it will <hi>Grace the Service</hi> I do not believe: unleſs by <hi>Gracing the Service,</hi> he intends, that it will give it a greater external Pomp and Splendour. And if that be his meaning, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will tell him, that the Service in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is much more <hi>Graceful,</hi> than that which is to be found in this <hi>Authors</hi> Church. Alas! Sir, <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi> is the Glory of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Worſhip, and the more there is of Pomp and Ceremony added to it, the leſs Beautiful and <hi>Graceful</hi> is it found. A Worſhip dreſſed up <hi>al a Mode de Romain</hi> with Ribbons, and Gaudy Topknots will not be Graceful in Gods account, how much ſoever ſome Superſtitious <hi>Fops</hi> may Admire and Applaud it. But is the Worſhip of God any thing the better for a few Gaudy Additions of Men? Will ſuch Fancies render it the more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, or the more Advantageous to the Worſhippers? To conclude either of theſe would be an Argument of Superſtition.</p>
               <p>But it will <hi>Pleaſe the Offerer</hi> he pretends. The Muſick may pleaſe his Ear, or delight his Fancy: But, I ſuppoſe what may gratifie the Sence and pleaſe the Fancy, muſt not preſently be admitted to have a room in Divine Worſhip: For if ſo, <hi>Hundreds</hi> of Fopperies might he brought into <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Aſſemblies, and be mixed with the Service there.</p>
               <p>He ſaith,<note place="margin">Ser. p. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>It is ſomewhat unreaſonable to ſuppoſe God will be delighted with ſuch unpleaſant and harſh Tones in his Service, as Men in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Diverſion would not endure.</hi> And for ought I know, it may be as unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that God will be delighted (who is a pure Spirit) with the ſweeteſt airs, and Melody of an Organ.</p>
               <q>— Non Muſica Chordula, ſed Cor.</q>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Second Uſe, he pretends, of his Organ, is to <hi>ſtir up the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40568:28"/>
Affections of the Soul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ser. p. 21. Ser. p. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>and make them the fitter for Devotion.</hi> And other where, he tells us, it is of uſe <hi>to exalt Mens Devotion.</hi> I would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you a few Remarks upon this. As (1.) Methinks the Muſick of the Voice ſhould be ſufficient for this purpoſe. The generality of Men, I think, concur in it, that Vocal Muſick is much more Sweet and Charming than Inſtrumental; and has as great a Power <hi>to raiſe</hi> and warm the <hi>Affections,</hi> as any the moſt Muſical Pipes upon Earth. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> had thought fit Inſtrumental Muſick ſhould have been uſed to this end in the times of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> I doubt not but it would have been the Matter of a Precept, as well as it was under the <hi>Law.</hi> (2.) But what does this Gentleman mean by <hi>Exciting the Affections?</hi> Does he intend, that the Melody of his Organ will excite good Thoughts, attended with ſuch an Agitation of the Blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; as is to be found in the Affections of Joy, Hope, Deſire, Love, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> If this be his Meaning, I utterly deny, that his Muſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by its Sweeteſt Harmony, will thus <hi>ſtur up the Affections</hi> of the Soul <hi>Neceſſarily.</hi> Perhaps <hi>Contingently</hi> ſometimes, the Muſick of an Organ may have ſuch an effect; which being granted, it will not thence follow that Organs may be Statedly uſed in the Worſhip of God for that end. For the ſight of a Croſs, or a Gallows may be the occaſion of the ſtirring up of good thoughts in a Man, yet, I ſuppoſe, none will thence be forward to conclude that they may be brought into <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Worſhip, and <hi>ſtatedly</hi> uſed there for that End. The ſight of a Deaths-head, of a Skeleton, or of a Lamb dead and bloody, may accidentally ſtir up ſome good Affections in ſome good Men. What! May they therefore be brought into Worſhipping Aſſemblies, and be ſet before the People as a means to ſtir up their Affections, and to excite their Devotions? And muſt we have <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Preached and Printed to inform Chriſtians in the excellent uſe of them to theſe purpoſes? I believe you will readily grant me that Miniſters Time and Abilities may be better imployed. How fond a thing is it for Miniſters to introduce their own private Fancies into their Congregations, and then by their Preachments to go about to perſwade People of the excellent uſe of them? (3.) Chriſt has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Concur with his own Ordinances duly Adminiſtred, but he has no where promiſed to concur with Mens groundleſs Fancies; and they have no reaſon to expect that Organs ſhould be thus uſeful to <hi>Excite Mens Affections,</hi> ſeeing it is no Appointment of the <hi>King</hi> of the Church to this end. (4.) If Organs are of uſe to <hi>ſtir</hi> up the Affections of Chriſtians in the Worſhip of God, and are to be uſed for that very end; why ſhould we not have more ſorts of Muſical Inſtruments, ſuch as Harps and Viols, Timbrels and Haut-bois, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the more to excite the Affections. For, I ſuppoſe, our <hi>Author</hi> will not deny, but that theſe have a vertue too, to excite Affections. So
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40568:28"/>
that if Organs will ſomewhat excite the Affections, the other Muſical Inſtruments will give ſome heightning addition. For <hi>Bonum bono additum, facit Majus bonum,</hi> Good added to good, makes the greater good. And ſo the more Muſical Inſtruments, ſuppoſing them well Conſorted, will raiſe the Affections the more. An excellent way this, to introduce all the Muſick of the <hi>Jewiſh Temple,</hi> and to fill every Pariſh-Church with a Choir of <hi>Levites.</hi> (5.) I grant that the Muſick and Melody of an Organ may put a pleaſing Motion upon the Blood and Spirits, may, perhaps, cauſe the Blood to glide along the Veins and Arteries with ſomewhat more of briskneſs. But what is this to the ſtirring up of Pious and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts in the Mind? Muſt a pleaſing motion of the Spirits neceſſarily be accompanied with ſerious, and devout Cogitations? Then whenever Perſons hear the ſound of an Organ in a <hi>Tavern,</hi> and have their Spirits pleaſingly agitated by it, they muſt all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily fall to their Devotions. But experience aſſures us, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' Organs are ſometimes found in thoſe places, yet rarely are they found very devout who frequent them.</p>
               <p>He Informs us,<note place="margin">Ser. p. 21.</note> that this ſort of Muſick is a <hi>Mighty Advantage to Religion.</hi> So then doubtleſs we may conclude them to be the beſt ſort of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who are favoured with the Melodious ſound of an Organ; becauſe from what our <hi>Author</hi> ſaith, we muſt ſuppoſe them to be the moſt Devout.</p>
               <p>But alas! this ſort of Talk is all pure Falacy. I remember in ſome of the <hi>Logick Syſtems</hi> I have formerly peruſed, I have met with an Inſtance of a Fallacious <hi>Sorites</hi> to this purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Qui benè bibit, benè dormit, qui benè dormit, non peccat, qui non peccat erit beatus, Ergo qui benè bibit erit beatus.</q>
               <p>Methinks our Author ſeeks to impoſe upon his Readers much what in the ſame manner; for at this rate, as far as I can ſound the depth of his Argument, does he reaſon.</p>
               <p>They who have the uſe of Organical Muſick in their Sacred Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies are moved or excited; they who are excited, are excited to Affections either of Joy or Sorrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They who thus have their Affections excited, have their Affections Spiritually excited. They who have their Affections Spiritually excited, are moſt devout Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of God; therefore they who have the uſe of Organical Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, are the moſt devout Worſhippers of God.</p>
               <p>I think a Man of little Penetration may eaſily diſcern the weakneſs of this way of Arguing: For altho' it may be allowed that the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of an Organ may put a pleaſing motion upon the Spirits, yet it follows not that it will ordinarily excite devout Affections.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:40568:29"/>He tells us, That <hi>it is the Nature of this Muſical Inſtrument thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently to excite and raiſe Mens Affections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The word <hi>[Nature]</hi> has a multiplicity of ſignifications; I wiſh I knew in what ſenſe he here meant it. Sometimes it is imployed to denote the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of a thing; at other times the <hi>Eſſential Property,</hi> &amp;c. It may be he underſtands the word <hi>Nature</hi> in the latter of theſe Senſes. So then what he aſſerts will amount to this: namely, that it is the <hi>Eſſential Property</hi> of an Organ <hi>to excite and raiſe Mens Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</hi> But then I am ſomewhat at a loſs again, what he intends by <hi>Exciting and raiſing Mens Affections.</hi> Either by <hi>raiſing</hi> the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> he means the ſtirring up the Affections of Religious Joy or Sorrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or the Affections of Nature, Joy and Sorrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If he intends the former; then let him prove that it is the <hi>Eſſential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi> of an Organ to ſtir up the Affections of a Religious Joy or Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if he means the latter, namely, that it is the <hi>Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al property</hi> of an Organ to ſtir up the Affections of a Natural Joy or Sorrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I do not ſee how his cauſe will gain any thing by it. For if Affections of Joy or Sorrow are excited, with reſpect to Objects, from whence Joy or Sorrow cannot be denominated Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; ſuch Affections will rather hinder Devotion, than help it. Therefore I ſuppoſe to ſuit his purpoſe, it may be his opinion, that it is the <hi>Eſſential Property</hi> of an Organ to Excite devout Affections: Which if true, it will follow, that when ever Perſons are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with the Muſick of an Organ, Devout Affections muſt be excited in them, but no Man will adventure to affirm this, unleſs he will contradict manifeſt experience: (6.) But if Organs may be uſed in the Worſhip of God to ſtir up the Affections by the <hi>ear;</hi> Why may not other things be brought into the Worſhip of God to ſtir up the Affections by the <hi>other Senſes?</hi> What thinks he of a <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix?</hi> Why may not that for the ſame reaſon be brought into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Aſſemblies, and be preſented to the Eyes of the Worſhippers? Suppoſe a Miniſter ſhould Preach a Paſſion Sermon, and with a great deal of moving Rhetorick ſhould decypher the bitter agony, and the painful Sufferings of our dying Lord, and in the midſt of his affectionate Diſcourſe ſhould pluck a <hi>Crucifix</hi> from under his Caſſock, preſenting it to the view of the People; with a behold the wound in his Side, the grating <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>orns on his Sacred Head, and the Blood ſtreaming from his gaping wounds! Can you ſee this bloody Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle without tears? Can you view this diſmal ſight without a ſigh? I ſay, ſhould a Miniſter do this, for ought I know the ſight of a <hi>Crucifix</hi> at ſuch a time might help to draw tears from the Eyes of many in the Aſſembly. I doubt not but it might raiſe a Paſſion of Sorrow in many of the Spectators; ſuppoſing they had no prejudice againſt ſuch an uſe of it.

in their Aſſemblies from this very Topick. Shall we therefore ſet up <hi>Crucifixes</hi> in our Churches? For my part, I am ſatisfied; that it is as lawful to ſet up a <hi>Crucifix</hi> in the Church to Affect the Soul by the <hi>Eye,</hi> as it is to ſet up an <hi>Organ</hi> to Affect the Soul by the <hi>Ear.</hi> Therefore, ſay I, if we muſt have <hi>Organs,</hi> let us have <hi>Crucifixes</hi> too. Tho' the Worſhip of God I am ſatisfied, is beſt with neither. If Miniſters ſhould aſcend their Pulpits with <hi>glittering Swords</hi> in their hands, brandiſhing them every time they denounced Woes againſt Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinners; it might raiſe the Affections of many of the Auditers. And Suppoſing it might have ſuch an effect, muſt it preſently be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, and be introduced into Publick Worſhip? Why upon the ſame pretence might not many affecting <hi>Pictures</hi> be hung about the Walls of the Churches, to ſtir up the Affections of the Worſhippers? <hi>That devotional Pictures are no helps to Excite Memory and Paſſion, is to forget that they are called</hi> Mute Poems, <hi>and to ſpeak againſt common ſenſe,</hi> ſaith his preſent Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi>

So that upon the ſame ſcore, that Organs are to be introduced into the Publick Churches, we may fill the Walls of the Churches with Varieties of Inſtructive Pictures to excite Devotion; and then our Churches may have their Walls garniſhed, and beautified, as are thoſe amongſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans.</hi> But ſhould we have our Churches hung about with ſuch Devotional Pictures, thoſe Objects would ſo much attract the Eye, and cauſe it to gaze about, that they would too much prevent the attention of the Mind to better things; as his Lordſhip, in the page referred to in the Margin, has determined. And for my own part, I am of Opinion, that it is with Organs in the Worſhip of God, as it is with Pictures in Churches; they rather prove a Diſtraction and Diverſion, than a help to Devotion. And many Men, perhaps as wiſe as our Author, have been of this Opinion, and many others are ſo to this day. <hi>Navar</hi>

Good Men frequently take an occaſion from the view of Plants, and Trees, and Flowers, to raiſe their Minds in devout Praiſes of their All-wiſe and Omnipotent Creator. Shall we therefore bring them into the Worſhip of God for this Uſe? In<note n="d" place="margin">Mor.

                  <q>I have been taught, <hi>ſaith that Author,</hi> that there are two ways to come at the Affections; one by the Senſes, and Imagination; and ſo we ſee People mightily affected with a Puppet-play, with a Beggar's Tone, with a Lamentable Look, or any thing of like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

of any Truth convincing the Mind, engages the Affections to its ſide, and makes them move according to its direction. Now I believe your Affections are moved in the firſt way very often; by melting Tones, pretty Similitudes, riming Sentences, kind, and loving Smiles, and ſometimes diſmally ſad Looks; beſides ſeveral Actions or Geſtures, which are very taking.— But the better ſort of Hearers are now out of love with theſe things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> I would beg you to conſider this, and to apply it to our preſent Caſe about the Power of Organs to excite the Affections in the Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>But to prove that Inſtrumental Muſick will thus excite the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, he produces <hi>Two remarkable Inſtances</hi> (as he ſaith) from Scripture.<note place="margin">Ser. p. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Both taken from the Practiſe of the Prophets in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Who, for the promoting of the Spirit of Prophecy within them, and the better raiſing their Intention towards God at that time, they called for the Muſicians to play before them.</hi> The one in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. where it is ſaid of <hi>Eliſha, And it came to paſs when the Minſtrel played, the hand of the Lord came upon him.</hi> The other is, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.5. where it is ſaid, <hi>The Company of Prophets came down from the High-place with a Pſaletry, and a Tabret, and a Pipe, and an Harp before them.</hi> I anſwer, (1.) I cannot believe that Inſtrumental Muſick was made uſe of by the Prophets in the Old-Teſtament to <hi>promote the Spirit of Prophecy within them.</hi> Our Author does not prove it. (2.) As to his firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance taken from <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s ſending for a Muſician; I cannot diſcern what good Influence it can have upon his Cauſe. The Praiſing of God with Inſtrumental Muſick in thoſe days, was the matter of a Divine Command. This ſort of Muſick was enjoyned them then for the quickning their Devotions: But now there is no ſuch Obligation lying upon us, for the uſe of them to ſuch an end. We have other Sacred Inſtitutions enough for that purpoſe. In ſhort, Inſtrumental Muſick was commanded by God then, and bleſſed for the exciting of Mens Affections in his Service: Therefore God will bleſs it now to the ſame end; is a Conſequence which will require our Authors ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Induſtry to make good. (3.) The caſe was plainly this. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi>'s Spirit at that time was ſomewhat ſad and heavy at the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Idolatry, and wickedneſs of the People amongſt whom he was. And the preſence of <hi>Jehoram</hi> had ſomewhat diſcompoſed him, as ſome ſuppoſe; Therefore that his Spirits might be quickned, and his heavineſs removed, he calls for a Muſician (probabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> to ſing ſome Divine Pſalm, or Hymn, that ſo his mind might be raiſed to Holy,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40568:31"/>
and Heavenly Meditations, and ſo he be the fitter to ask, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Prophetical Inſpirations. So that our Authors Argument from hence, as far as I can ſee, will amount to no more than this, <hi>viz. Eliſha</hi> made uſe of an Ordinance of God then, to raiſe his Affections, to ſtir up his mind to holy Meditations, and to calm his diſturbed Spirit. Therefore <hi>Chriſtians</hi> may make uſe of an Ordinance of God to excite their Affections in theſe times of the Goſpel. This, I think, is all can be warrantably inferred from this Inſtance. But becauſe an Ordinance of God was then made uſe of to excite Affections in God's Service; therefore now that which is no Ordinance of God may be uſed continually in the praiſing of God to that end, is a very wide Conſequence.</p>
               <p>As to his other Inſtance, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.5. where it is ſaid, <hi>That the company of Prophets came down from the High-place with a Pſaltery, a Tabret, and a Pipe, and a Harp before them.</hi> I ſee nothing in it to warrant Perſons to introduce Organical Muſick into the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Aſſemblies of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Theſe <hi>Prophets</hi> were Perſons who whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoted themſelves to Religious Studies, and Exerciſes, ſuch as Preaching, Praying, and Praiſing of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſometimes God communicated to them the Knowledge of future things. Theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons came down from the High-place; where at that time perhaps they had been offering Sacrifice.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pool</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> And altho' they were wont to perform that Exerciſe of Singing Gods Praiſes, either in their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or in the place of their Sacrifices, yet now they did it in the deſcent of the Hill. And they made uſe of Muſical Inſtruments for the Exhileration and Excitation of their Spirits, as Prophets and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons at that time were wont to do; as being an Ordinance of Divine Appointment.</p>
               <p>But let us ſee how our Author will improve all this to infer the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of Inſtrumental Muſick in the Worſhip under the New-Teſtament Diſpenſation.<note place="margin">Ser. p. 22, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>In both which places it is obſervable, that 'twas nothing but Inſtrumental Muſick, which was made uſe of in thoſe caſes to awaken their Souls, and to ſtir up the Spirit of Prophecy in them. And from thence I argue</hi> a Fortiori; <hi>If theſe were able to ſtir up the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Principles of their Souls for ſuch a Mighty thing, as the conveying the Prophetick Spirit into another among the</hi> Jews; <hi>certainly they may well be concluded proper and uſeful for the ſtirring up the Spirit of Prayer, and to move the Affections of the Soul, that they may be the fitter for the Worſhip of God in the</hi> Chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p>To which Learned paſſage I have a few things to ſay. As (1.) He talks of <hi>Stirring up the Spirit of Prophecy in them,</hi> and <hi>ſtirring up the Inſpired Principles of their Souls.</hi> As if the Gift of Prophecy had either been a <hi>Natural Faculty,</hi> or an <hi>Infuſed Habit,</hi> which they could have awakened to action at pleaſure. His Expreſſions can import no leſs,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40568:31"/>
than the Spirit of Prophecy was, according to our Author, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent inſpired Principle in the Soul, whoſe acts a Perſon might elicite, when ere he had a mind. But if I miſtake not, the Sacred Scriptures will better inform him in this matter. Be pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult thoſe Texts at your leiſure, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.27. <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.33, 34.<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Witſii.</hi> Miſcel. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cr. p. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Levit.</hi> 24.12. Nay, the Text he had juſt before cited, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.15. where it is ſaid, <hi>And it came to paſs when the Minſtrel played, the hand of the Lord came upon him,</hi> would have better inſtructed him, if he had but attended to it. <hi>The hand of the Lord came upon him,</hi> does not, I ſuppoſe import an internal Principle. Prophecy was not an inherent Principle, but a Gift of God, which he beſtowed on whom, and when he pleaſed. Be pleaſed to conſult <hi>Pool</hi>'s <hi>Synopſis</hi> on 2 <hi>King,</hi> 3.15. and you will there find enough to give you ſatisfaction in this Point. So that, what our Author has advanced here, I look upon as a fundamental Miſtake as to the preſent Argument, and ſo what he builds upon it, muſt of conſequence be precarious. (2.) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I take leave to deny that Inſtrumental Muſick in the alledged Caſes, was made uſe of to <hi>ſtir up the Spirit of Prophecy</hi> in the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Perſons. Altho' this Author confidently aſſerts it. The Texts he has produced, ſay no ſuch thing. The Spirit of Prophecy was not a Dormant Habit in the Prophets, which needed to be awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Melody of an Harp, or a Timbrel. I wonder who taught our Author thus to ſpeak. (3.) Now for his Illation hence. <hi>If theſe were able to ſtir up the Inſpired Principles of their Souls for ſuch a mighty thing, as the conveying the Prophetick Spirit into another among the Jews, certainly,</hi> &amp;c. Certainly the Author was half a ſleep when he pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this paſſage. For, (1.) Here is a want of true Grammar. What is the Antecedent to [theſe?] What <hi>(Inſtrumental Muſick)</hi> in the Singular Number? <hi>Cavete Grammatici!</hi> for ought I know, may be as pertinent here, as <hi>Cavete Scote</hi> in another place. (2) But in the next place we have a moſt notable Diſcovery; which, I believe none ever ſtumbled on before. I could wiſh ſome Learned Perſon or other would put it into the next Edition of <hi>Pool</hi>'s <hi>Synopſis.</hi> For, I am ſatisfied, it is not there as yet. Now this mighty diſcovery is, <hi>That the Inſpired Principles in the Souls of the Prophets, could do ſuch a mighty thing, as to convey the Prophetick Spirit into another Perſon.</hi> What their Inſpired Principles convey the Prophetick Spirit into another? Whence learns he this ſtrange Paradox? I very much queſtion the truth of it; and would beg our Author to prove it ſubſtantially, when he ſhall oblige the World with a ſecond Edition of his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Sermon.</hi> But if he will prove it to purpoſe, he muſt be ſure to do theſe two things, (1.) He muſt prove that the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy,</hi> was the <hi>Inſpired Principles of the Souls of the Prophets.</hi> That alone will, I fear prove a pretty difficult Province. (2.) He muſt prove that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40568:32"/>
the <hi>Inſpired Principles of the Souls of the Prophets, were capable of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prophetick Spirit into another.</hi> And this, I preſume, he will find a deſperate task. (4.) But from all this he would infer, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental Muſick may now be uſed in <hi>Chriſtian Churches to ſtir up the Spirit of Prayer.</hi> But I ſtill deny the conſequence. All that can duly be inferred from theſe inſtances, is only thus much, <hi>viz.</hi> That Perſons now in theſe times of the Goſpel may make uſe of an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God for the Excitation of their Devotions, and for the Compoſing of their Diſturbed Minds, that they may ſerve God the better. Inſtrumental Muſick was then an Ordinance of God, now no longer ſuch. But I have already alledged ſeveral reaſons againſt ſuch an inference as our Author here makes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ser. p. 24.</note>But our Author comes at length to read us a long Lecture of the great power of Muſick, and takes a great deal of pains to inform us in the Admirable effects which have ſometimes been produced by it. And here he treats us with the Inſtance of the Famous <hi>Muſician,</hi> who played before <hi>Alexander,</hi> and with that of <hi>Terpander.</hi> And tells us how <hi>Achilles</hi>'s fury was appeaſed by Muſick.

And becauſe our Author cites us a paſſage from Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> concerning the great Power and Excellency of Muſick, I ſhall take leave to entertain you with another paſſage from the ſame Author, much to my preſent purpoſe. For ſaith he<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Temples</hi> Miſſell. Part. 2. p. 45.</note>, <q>'Tis agreed by the Learned, that the Science of Muſick, ſo admired of the Ancients, is wholly loſt in the World; and that what we have now, is made
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40568:32"/>
up of certain Notes that fell into the fancy, or obſervation of a poor <hi>Fryar</hi> in chanting his Mattins.</q> All this being duely conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all our Authors little Stories out of <hi>Plutarch</hi> and others, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be little to his purpoſe. But ſuppoſing Muſick to have a great efficacy now, this will not warrant us to introduce Inſtrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick into the Chriſtian Worſhip. For ſeeing we have Vocal Muſick, we have Muſick, and I think the beſt ſort of Muſick. For, if I miſtake not, the generality of mankind judge Vocal Muſick to be ſweeteſt, and the beſt. Therefore, we having Vocal Muſick in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches, we have ſufficient for the excitation of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. It is what Chriſt and his Apoſtles thought ſufficient, and therefore I ſuppoſe we ſhall not err being of the ſame judgment. He tells us, that <hi>Xenocrates cured Madmen by the means</hi> of Muſick. Let him remove his Organ to <hi>Bedlam,</hi> and try the Experiment there ſay I.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Another uſe, he tells us, of Church-Muſick, and particularly of the Organ is, that it will <hi>compoſe Mens thoughts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ser. p. 25.</note> and <hi>drive away evil ſuggeſtions from their Minds at their Devotion.</hi> Our Author aſſerts this with reſpect to his Organ, but I do not find that he proves it. But we have Vocal Muſick for this end, which can plead a Divine Inſtitution, and therefore his Organ is uſeleſs in the Caſe. God has promiſed to concur with his own Inſtitutions to theſe purpoſes, but he has made no ſuch promiſe to the uſe of Organs.</p>
               <p>But adds our Author, <hi>It will tend much to rid Mens minds of all thoſe ſad and gloomy, and melancholy, and luſtful Imaginations, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb, and diſcompoſe them.</hi> That Inſtrumental Muſick of its ſelf has ſuch a tendency, I would intreat our Author to prove.

And then he concludes his Marginal Note thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I appeal to the Experience of Diſſenters, whether they are not much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and think themſelves edified with the pleaſing Tone, and Cadencies, and Elevations of the Voice of their Preachers? And then, whether they might not be aſſiſted with the Sweeter ſounds of Muſical Inſtruments?</hi> I Reply (1.) I believe that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> will not pretend that they are Edified by the Tone, Cadencies, and Elevations of the Voice of their Teachers; but by the matter they methodically deliver. True it is, they like that Miniſters ſhould Elevate their Voices to ſuch a degree, as that they may be plainly heard by all their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; and that they ſhould deliver their Diſcourſes with ſomewhat of Warmth, and Affection, that their Hearers may have no cauſe to think they are not in earneſt in what they ſpeak. For Miniſters in their Sermons to uſe a low and whiſpering Voice, ſo that ſcarce half of their Congregations can hear what is ſaid, I am certain is not very edifying. And to deliver their Diſcourſes without any thing of a <hi>Pathos,</hi> in a cold, and a careleſs manner, is not the way to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the People that they are in earneſt. Upon this occaſion, I
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40568:33"/>
would preſent you with a Paſſage of the Ingenious Dr. <hi>Glanvil</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Eſſay of Preaching. p. 54.</note> Speaking of Miniſters, ſaith he, <hi>for us to be cold and heartleſs in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring things of ſo vaſt a moment, ſuggeſts that we believe not what we ſay. And it cannot be expected, that others ſhould be much moved by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the Preacher himſelf ſeems unconcerned. Juſtinian</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour made a Law in theſe words. <hi>We will, and command, that all Biſhops and Prieſts celebrate the Sacred Oblation, and the Prayers thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to added in holy Baptiſm, not in a low voice, but with a loud, and clear Voice, which may be heard by the Faithful People;</hi>

                  <hi>that thereby the Minds of the Hearers may be raiſed up, with greater Devotion to ſet forth the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Lord God.</hi> (2) Diſſenters own that they are affected by the Voice of their Teachers in Conjunction with the matter they deliver, but not that they are affected with a Voice, where the Doctrine is not ſound, nor the matter ſolid. (3.) Our Author would do well to conſider, that Preaching is an Ordinance of God, and then no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Diſſenters are affected with the Diſcourſes of their Teachers, delivered with a taking Voice; ſeeing that the inſtructing of People by the Voice, is what God has made a Duty by a plain Injunction. But then, adds he, <hi>Might they not be aſſiſted with the ſweeter ſounds of Muſical Inſtruments?</hi> I anſwer, No. From the uſe of the Voice in the Worſhip of God, which God commands, and approves, to the uſe of Muſical Inſtruments in the ſame, amongſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which he has not enjoined or approved of, is a very conſiderable leap. God's Ordinances are ſufficient for the ends, for which they were inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neither need they the ſweet ſounds of Muſical Inſtruments ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to render them the more pleaſing to God, or the more edifying and advantageous to the People. It is a fond conceit the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have taken up; that many External Rites and Ceremonies are to be uſed in the Worſhip of God, appointed of the Church, for the <hi>raiſing the Affections and exciting the Devotions of the Worſhippers.</hi> Hence it is that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> clamours, <hi>Apud nos Altaria, Cruces,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Our Altars, Croſſes, Images, Relicks, and the very Walls, which are Dedicated to God, ſtir up Perſons to Piety.</hi> But ſuch means for the exciting of Spiritual Affections God never Appointed, the Apoſtles never uſed, the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians were altogether Strangers to.</p>

Splendour of Gold, of Jewels, and Ivory, dazle their Eyes; and they think Religion cannot be there where theſe do not ſhine; therefore they come to the Gods, not ſo much for the ſake of Religion, as that they may feaſt their eyes with the Gold, and the Nitar of the poliſhed Marble: And the more their Temples are adorned, the more beautiful their Images, ſo much the more of Majeſty they are ſuppoſed to have. So that the Religion of the Gods, is no other, than what the Luſts of Men admire.</hi> Now this reply which <hi>Lactantius</hi> gives the <hi>Heathens</hi> with a little variation, will ſerve as a full Anſwer to our Author, with reſpect to that Solemnity and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty which he ſuppoſes his Organ conciliates to Divine Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.)

               <p n="5">(5.) If the Organ renders the <hi>Worſhip of God more Solemn and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> it is ſtrange the Primitive Chriſtians, eſpecially in the times of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſhould no more conſult the Honour of Gods Sacred Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, than thus to leave it diveſted of ſo excellent an Ornament as the Organ is pretended to be! But the true reaſon why the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians admitted nothing of Inſtrumental Muſick into their Churches, was becauſe they thought it a part of the Ceremonious Worſhip of the <hi>Temple,</hi> which was aboliſhed by the coming of Chriſt; as has been largely proved already.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) It is an Argument the Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church make uſe of to defend their Latin Service, namely, that it gives a <hi>Majeſty</hi> and <hi>Solemnity</hi> to the Divine Offices. And if the Argument be judged by Reformed Divines as inconcluſive in that caſe, I cannot ſee any reaſon why it ſhould be concluſive in the caſe of Organs?</p>
               <p>Adds our Author, <hi>It will make the People more Serious,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Le Blanc</hi>'s Theſes. p. 319.</note> 
                  <hi>and Reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial when they are at it.</hi> It is eaſily ſaid. But whence is it that the ſound of an Organ ſhould be able thus to form People into ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? I am ſtrongly inclined to believe, that Vocal ſinging of Pſalms is far more likely to be attended with this effect. For when Perſons ſhall conſider it to be a plain Duty enforced with a Divine poſitive Precept, it will be apt to put their minds into a ſerious, and awful Temper. But why Inſtrumental Muſick (which has nothing but Humane Fancy, and Command to back and ſupport it) ſhould make Perſons thus Serious and Reverent, I cannot imagine. If the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Matter ſung in Chriſtian Aſſemblies, if the Vocal Muſick of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40568:35"/>
Gods Appointment are not ſufficient to render Perſons ſerious and reverent, I am ſatisfied, that an Organ will nothing conduce to ſuch an end. Has an Organ ſuch a Vertue? I would then crave the favour to be informed, whether it has this vertue from its ſelf, and ſo it is the Natural effect of it? Or whether it hath it, from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God commanding it? If it has this Vertue from its ſelf, then, methinks, it ſhould always have this effect upon Perſons who are gratified with the ſound of it: which, I am ſatisfied, it has not. Sometimes the carriage of Perſons in Cathedrals, whilſt the Organs play, is a convincing evidence of it. But ſhould he aſſert an Organ to have its vertue to inſpire Perſons with <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Seriouſneſs,</hi> from the Authority of God commanding it; then will he be obliged to diſcover to us where this Command is to be found; which, I preſume, he will not be over-haſty to do.

               </p>
               <p>But this is an Argument of no force with him. And the <hi>Geneva Annotations</hi> muſt have the Epithite of <hi>Pernicious</hi> given them, becauſe

But why is this <hi>Gentleman</hi> ſo wroth with the <hi>Geneva</hi> Annotations? <hi>It is great pitty,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that they ſhould he Printed with the Bible.</hi> Why, what is the matter? <hi>O they are contrary to the ſenſe and meaning of the Bible in many places.</hi> Are they ſo? But, I ſuppoſe our Author muſt be judge of that, and then it is impoſſible they ſhould eſcape a Cenſure. But it may be our Author himſelf may be <hi>miſtaken about the ſenſe of many Texts of Scripture.</hi> But ſuppoſing it, for once, to be true, that the <hi>Geneva Annotations</hi> are contrary to the meaning of the Bible in many places, is this Argument enough for the ſtiffing them, that they may never be Printed more? At the ſame rate, I think the greateſt part of the Annotations, or Comments on the <hi>Bible</hi> ought to be ſuppreſt. For how few are there but do miſtake the ſenſe and meaning of the <hi>Bible</hi> in many places? Some will not except the Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s, nor Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>'s with the <hi>Continuators,</hi> nor thoſe of the great <hi>Grotius.</hi> And yet is it pity theſe ſhould be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Should all the <hi>Annotations</hi> upon the <hi>Bible</hi> be ſuppreſt, which have ſome things in them contrary to the ſenſe and meaning of it, I fear we ſhould have but very few left. (3.) Methinks this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould have conſidered, that theſe Annotations were firſt Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed many Years ago; when the <hi>Annotators</hi> had not ſuch excellent Helps for the writing <hi>Annotations</hi> upon the <hi>Bible,</hi> as we enjoy in the preſent Age. This, methinks, ſhould ſomewhat have checked the ſharpneſs of his Stile againſt theſe <hi>Annotators.</hi> But alas! He is utterly fallen out with <hi>Geneva,</hi> tho' I believe, he knows not why.</p>

Preface to the <hi>Aſſemblies Annotations.</hi> 
                  <q>The <hi>Geneva Bible</hi> with the Notes, was preſented with a ſpecial Dedication to the Incomperable Princeſs Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which was received with ſuch acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and general liking of her People, that from that time until the Edition of the laſt Tranſlation of the Bible, it was Printed by <hi>Hers,</hi> and her <hi>Rightful and Royal Succeſſors Printers,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty times over. Tho' it was their miſhap, (without any merit) to be noted with a black-coal, as guilty of miſ-interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, touching the Divinity of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Meſſiah-ſhip; and as Simbolizing with <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> againſt them both; and this was publickly charged upon them by an Academical <hi>Doctor</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>H.</hi>
                     </note> in a Solemn Aſſembly of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford.</hi> But of this Crime they were more than abſolved by Sir <hi>Thomas Bodly</hi> (the famous Founder, and Furniſher of the Publick Library) <hi>his Letter</hi> written in their Defence and Praiſe, which was read by the <hi>Doctor of the Chair</hi> in St. <hi>Marys</hi> Pulpit, and by his, and the Orthodox Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Univerſity Silencing the <hi>Doctor</hi> for his <hi>Un-orthodox,</hi> and <hi>Scandalous Sermons;</hi> whereby the Church and State were involved in a high and heinous degree of guilt (if the Notes were ſo unſound as he had ſuggeſted) for allowing them to be Paſſable and Publick by ſo many Impreſſions.</q> I preſume our Author never dreamt of this Paſſage: But I wiſh he would conſider it for the future.</p>
               <p>But to come to the Objection its ſelf. Say the Annotators, <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſick was a part of the Ceremonial Law, and was well enough ſuited to that Infant ſtate.</hi> Well, What ſaith our Gentleman to this? He utterly diſlikes it. But do not many of the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> ſay the ſame? Do not <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> St <hi>Chryſoſtome, Iſidore Pelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiota, Theodoret,</hi> and the <hi>Author Queſt. &amp; Reſpon. ad Orthodoxos</hi> ſpeak to the ſame purpoſe? Conſult the collected Paſſages I have given you above. So that the <hi>Geneva Annotators</hi> can pretend to better An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity for what they ſay, than our Author can produce. The <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Fathers</hi> ſpeak plain in our Caſe, when as they have not a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Sentence to befriend our Authors Organ. Where there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now is the mighty boaſt of Antiquity? But what will this <hi>Gentleman</hi> ſay, if it ſhould be proved to him, That the <hi>Church of England</hi> in her <hi>Homilies</hi> ſo far agrees with <hi>Geneva</hi> here, as to account the uſe of Organs in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches to be Unlawful. This, for ought I know, may a little ſweeten him. Yet this I hope clearly to prove e're I conclude.</p>
               <p>But let us ſee how our Author will confute this Objection: well he hath two things to ſay to it.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>That the Inſtitution of Muſical Inſtruments in the Service of God was never a part of the Ceremonial Law, and therefore the uſe of it was not to be done away at the coming of Chriſt.</hi> And this he will prove.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40568:37"/>
Nay, if he will prove it, I fear he will prove more than he deſigns: He will prove it not only lawful, but a Duty ſtill to uſe them. For they under the <hi>Moſaical oeconomy</hi> had an expreſs command for the uſe of them, and if that Command be not vacated, but continue in force ſtill, then ſay I it is a Duty ſtill, and not meerly a thing Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>But he will prove Inſtrumental Muſick to have been <hi>no part of the Ceremonial Law,</hi> and that by Two Arguments. His Firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe it <hi>was in uſe before the Law was given.</hi> And here he accoſts us again with the Inſtance of <hi>Miriam, Exod.</hi> 15.20. But I have ſaid enough to take off the force of this Objection, in Anſwer to his Firſt Argument for the Lawfulneſs of Inſtrumental Muſick in Chriſtian Worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dancing</hi> was uſed before the giving of the Law in this Authors ſenſe. The ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Sacrificing</hi> and <hi>Circumciſion.</hi> But will our Author affirm theſe to have been no part of the Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Law? I cannot ſuppoſe he will.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Becauſe Inſtrumental Muſick was not <hi>Eſtabliſhed any where by the Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ser. p. 22, 33.</note> 
                  <hi>nor till above Five hundred Years after the ratifying and ſealing of it up. Trumpets</hi> are Muſical Inſtruments, as I take it; yet were they eſtabliſhed by the Law in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s days. That they were ſo, I think, is not only apparent from, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. but alſo from, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.3, 4. <hi>Blow up the Trumpet in the New moon, in the time appointed, on our Solemn Feaſt-day, for this was a ſtatute for</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and a Law of the God of</hi> Jacob. <hi>This was a Law of God,</hi> it is ſaid. Hereupon, I would ask our Author, if I were near him, Whether this command was a part of the <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> of the <hi>Moral,</hi> or <hi>Judicial</hi> Law? If a part of the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law, then was Inſtrumental Muſick enjoyned by that Law. But he will not allow of this. Well then, was it a part of the <hi>Judicial Law?</hi> Then would it have appertained only to the Civil Government, which it did not. But was it then a part of the <hi>Moral Law?</hi> If ſo, then the uſe of Inſtrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick in the Worſhip of God, is a <hi>Moral</hi> Duty, and ſo not barely Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. But the Law commanding the uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick in the Worſhip of God was not a <hi>Judicial</hi> or <hi>Moral</hi> precept, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt have been a <hi>Ceremonial</hi> one.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ser. p. 33.</note>But in the Margin of his <hi>Sermon,</hi> he excepts <hi>Trumpets</hi> himſelf, and allows them to have been appointed by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law. But then he adds, <hi>They were appointed for the calling of Aſſemblies, &amp;c.</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by that <hi>[&amp;c.]</hi> he intends that there was ſome other uſe of them, beſide <hi>calling the Aſſemblies.</hi> The Prieſts, the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> the High-Prieſt were to blow the <hi>Trumpets.</hi> (1.) At the removal of the Camp, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.2, 6. <hi>Make thee Two Trumpets of Silver, that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40568:37"/>
thou maieſt uſe them for the journeying of the Camps.</hi> (2.) At the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Feaſts, to call and Aſſemble the People together. <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Make uſe of them for the calling the Aſſembly.</hi> (3.) At the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation of War, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.9. <hi>If you go to War in your Land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Enemy that oppreſſeth you, then ye ſhall blow an Alarm with the Trumpets.</hi> But this was not all the uſe of them. For (4) They were to blow the Trumpets at the Oblation of Sacrifices, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Alſo in the day of your gladneſs, and in your ſolemn days, and in the beginnings of your Months, ye ſhall blow with your Trumpets over your Burnt-offerings, and over the Sacrifices of your Peace-offerings, that they may be to you for a memorial before your God.</hi> Here we find that <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets</hi> were uſed in the Worſhip of God. I might add. (5.) They were alſo blown at times of preſent or imminent Calamity, for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Humiliation, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.15. Hence the Learned<note n="*" place="margin">Notes on <hi>Num.</hi> 10.9.</note> Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> ſpeaking of theſe <hi>Trumpets,</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is to be conſidered, that they were obliged by the blowing of the Trumpets to be awakened to a ſenſe of their Sin, and the need of Gods Mercy, Iſa.</hi> 58.1. So that the <hi>Trumpets</hi> were of a Sacred Uſe: And ſeeing they were appointed by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law for ſuch an uſe, we may conclude, that <hi>Trumpets,</hi> and ſo Muſical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments were part of the Ceremonial Law. Therefore it ſeems ſtrange to me, that our Author ſhould aſſert;<note place="margin">Ser. p. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>That Inſtruments of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick were not appointed in Divine Service in</hi> Moſes<hi>'s time.</hi> What! Was not the Oblation of Sacrifices Divine Service? And were not the Trumpets to be ſounded in that Service?</p>
               <p>But adds he, <hi>It is plain that they were an Inſtitution of</hi> David <hi>in his moſt flouriſhing ſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True indeed, by order from God, <hi>David</hi> added more Muſical Inſtruments to thoſe which had been formerly uſed. But Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Muſick in Divine Worſhip was not firſt Inſtituted in his time. As has been proved already, and may be farther ſhewen e're I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>
               <p>But to improve this, he thus argues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It appearing to be of</hi> David<hi>'s Inſtitution could not be a part of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law.</hi> I deny that Aſſertion. For altho' Inſtrumental Muſick, was, by order from God, Appointed by <hi>David,</hi> yet might it be part of the Ceremonial Law. And here again I would demand to know, if Inſtrumental Muſick was commanded in the Service of God by a Law, by what Law it was enjoyned? Not by the Moral nor Judicial Laws, therefore by the Ceremonial. And therefore ſtill to uſe our Authors Phraſe, <hi>It was a part of the Ceremonial Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how does he prove that Inſtrumental Muſick could not be a part of the Ceremonial Law, becauſe of <hi>David</hi>'s Inſtitution? Why thus, Becauſe <hi>the Ceremonial Law was compleated before by</hi> Moſes, <hi>in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40568:38"/>
thoſe words,</hi> Deut. 12.32. <hi>What thing ſoever I command you, obſerve to do it, thou ſhalt not add thereto, nor diminiſh from it.</hi> But (1.) That the <hi>Ceremonial Law was compleated before by</hi> Moſes, ſo as that there was no addition afterwards made to it, is, I conceive, a miſtake. For the number of <hi>Trumpets</hi> according to the firſt Inſtitution of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> was but <hi>two;</hi> for the two Sons of <hi>Aaron, Eleazer</hi> and <hi>Ithamar,</hi> the Prieſts, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Make thee two Trumpets of Silver.</hi> But in <hi>Solomons</hi> time the Number of them was greatly Augmented: For we read of a <hi>Hundred and Twenty Prieſts,</hi> who ſounded with Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets at the <hi>Dedication</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Alſo the</hi> Levites, <hi>which were the Singers, being arayed in white Linnen, having Cymbals, and Pſalteries, and Harps, and with them one hundred and Twenty Prieſts ſounding with Trumpets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again <hi>Moſes</hi> appointed but <hi>one Table</hi> for the Shew-bread to be ſet upon, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.23. <hi>Thou ſhalt alſo make a Table of Shittim-wood,</hi> &amp;c. And but <hi>one Candleſtick</hi> of Pure Gold, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.31. <hi>And thou ſhalt make a Candleſtick of pure Gold,</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>one Laver, Exod.</hi> 30.18. <hi>Thou ſhalt alſo make a Laver of Braſs.</hi> But then in <hi>Solomons</hi> time there were many of theſe. He augmented them all to the Number of <hi>ten.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. <hi>He made alſo</hi> ten <hi>Lavers, and he made</hi> ten <hi>Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks of Gold according to their form; and he made alſo</hi> ten <hi>Tables, and placed them in the Temple.</hi> So that here was a conſiderable addition made to the Sacred Rites, enjoyned by the Ceremonial Law, in the time of <hi>Solomon.</hi> And this, I think, fairly baffles the opinion of our Author; namely, That <hi>the Ceremonial Law was compleated before by</hi> Moſes. (2) But I ſhall next examine the Argument he produces to prove, that the Ceremonial Law was compleated by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he attempts the proof of this, from <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32. <hi>What thing ſoever I command you, obſerve to do it, thou ſhalt not add thereto, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh from it.</hi> As to this Argument, I take leave to deny the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the Major Propoſition. Becauſe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to do in the Worſhip of God, whatever God had commanded them, and not make any additions of their own thereto, therefore the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law was compleated by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and God made no farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to it in the times of <hi>Solomon;</hi> is a conſequence I cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of, and he muſt prove it well, before I ſhall think my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſuppoſe it Warrantable.</p>
               <p>I have, I think, convincingly proved, that there were ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions made to the Ceremonial Law in the times of <hi>Solomon:</hi> And that is ſufficient to weaken his Conſequence, and to make his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appear inconcluſive. If our <hi>Author</hi> will make good what he has undertaken to prove, he muſt do this, <hi>viz.</hi> Prove that thoſe Words, <hi>Whatſoever thing I command you, obſerve to do it, thou ſhalt not add thereto,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40568:38"/>
nor diminiſh from it;</hi> do import, that <hi>Solomon</hi> was not even by Gods Order and appointment, to make any addition at all to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law. Thoſe words. <hi>[thou ſhalt not add thereto]</hi> did abſolutely forbid any of Mankind of their own heads to make any addition to the Law of God. But I ſee no reaſon to think, that God thereby intended to lay a Reſtraint upon himſelf, that in af er times he might not make any addition to his Ceremonial Law. Methinks that Text, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.39. <hi>Remember all the Commandments of the Lord, and do them, and that ye ſeek not after your own heart, and your own eyes, after which you uſe to go a whoring;</hi> is a fair Comment: on <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32. Men are too prone to bring ſomething of their own into the Worſhip of God; to introduce their own fancies as a Supplement to Divine Inſtitutions; and God well knowing Mens Propenſity to this, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad them to make any addition to his Laws and Sacred Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But he ſaid not that he would not make any additions of his own. For my part, I am of opinion, that the Ceremonial Law had its commencement long before the Times of <hi>Moſes;</hi> it had very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple additions made to it by <hi>Moſes</hi> according to God's Appointment, and had its utmoſt complement in the days of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I miſtake not. I have offered conſiderable Reaſons for this; but whether I have or no, I leave you to judge. Thus I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered his <hi>Firſt Argument</hi> to prove Inſtrumental Muſick to have been no part of the Ceremonial Law, and I preſume, I have given a fair Reply to it.</p>
               <p>But if that will not do, he has a Reſerve, with which he makes a Second Attack. Therefore ſaith he, <hi>I Anſwer in the Second place,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2d. Arg.</note> 
                  <hi>That if Inſtrumental Muſick was a part of the Ceremonial Law, and to be done away in Chriſt, it would have been,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ser. p. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>as thoſe other Typical things were, a ſhadow of ſomewhat to come, which was to be done away by the coming of that Subſtance, but no ſuch thing being to be made appear, we may rationally conclude, this is not to be done away under the Goſpel.</hi> And to this I rejoin. (1.) That Inſtrumental Muſick uſed in the Worſhip of God in the times of the Legal Adminiſtration was a part <hi>of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law,</hi> (to keep the Expreſſion, which I find our Author diſlikes not) I think I have proved above, and ſo I need ſay no more. But yet. (2.) I ſhall attend this his Argument. If this Muſick had been a part of the Ceremonial Law, then would it have been Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical, as the other things which were to be done away by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But Inſtrumental Muſick was not Typical therefore Inſtrumental Muſick was no part of the Ceremonial Law.</p>
               <p>This is his Argument in the full ſtrength of it. Now Divines Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ply to this Argument two ways. (1.) Sometimes by Denying the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40568:39"/>
                  <hi>Minor.</hi> (2) Sometimes by calling in queſtion the conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The <hi>Fathers,</hi> whom I have formerly cited, tell us, that this ſort of Muſick was Typical, or a ſhadow of ſomething to come, and ſo they deny his <hi>Minor.</hi> They aſſure us that the Inſtrumental Muſick of the <hi>Temple,</hi> was deſigned to ſhadow forth Chriſtians praiſing of God with the Organs of their Bodies in the times of the Goſpel. I refer you to the Quotations out of them above.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Proteſtant Commentators</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 150. ſpeak to the ſame purpoſe. Nay <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf, tho' a great ſtickler for the Sacred uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick, yet in his Annotations on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.3. ſeems to acknowledge the ſame. I ſhall not inſert his words, but leave you to peruſe them in his own Works.</p>
               <p>That the Inſtrumental Muſick of the Temple was Typical, ſome ſuppoſe to be evident from that Text, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.8. Where <hi>Harps</hi> are joined with the <hi>Golden Viols full of Odours.</hi> Now that the Odours were Typical, they preſume will be granted them; for ſaith the Text, <hi>which are the Prayers of the Saints.</hi> And add they, it is the plain deſign of this place to deſcribe the Prayers and the Praiſes of the Saints in the Goſpel times; the Prayers of the Saints are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Odours, and their Praiſes by Harps, as having been Types of theſe things.</p>
               <p>But our Author attempts the proof of the <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition, <hi>viz. That Inſtrumental Muſick of Old was not Typical.</hi> For ſaith he, <hi>No ſuch thing being to be made appear.</hi> So that his Argument reduced to form will be this.</p>
               <p>That which cannot be made to appear to have been Typical, was not Typical.</p>
               <p>But that Inſtrumental Muſick of old was Typical, cannot be made to appear.</p>
               <p>Therefore Inſtrumental Muſick of old was not Typical.</p>
               <p>That I may give a clear, and a full Anſwer to this Argument, I ſhall crave leave to tell you, that that term <hi>(cannot be made to appear)</hi> may be underſtood in a twofold ſenſe. Either (1.) the meaning of it may be, <hi>it cannot be proved by good Argument.</hi> And if it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in that ſenſe, I deny the <hi>Minor, viz.</hi> That it cannot be made to appear that Inſtrumental Muſick of old was Typical. I conceive I have made it appear ſo far already, as that I have proved it. (2.) Or the meaning of that term may be, that the particular thing or things, which the Inſtrumental Muſick of the Temple ſhadowed forth cannot be aſſigned. Well perhaps, we may not be able to make appear what the Inſtrumental Muſick of the Temple ſignified; or what it was an Adumbration of. What then? Muſt we thence conclude it was not Typical? Becauſe we are ignorant of what it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40568:39"/>
was deſigned to repreſent, Muſt we therefore deny it to have been a ſhadow of ſome future thing? Is it allowable for Perſons to argue from their Ignorance of a thing, to its abſolute Non-exiſtence? I believe no Wiſe Mans Logick will warrant ſuch an Inference. I am very prone to believe, that there were many Rites injoyned by the Ceremonial Law in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as to which our Author can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not certainly inform us what they were Typical of. He may ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gueſs and conjecture, it may be, what they were deſigned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, but he cannot convincingly prove to us, that they were to ſhadow forth juſt ſuch, or ſuch things. As for inſtance.</p>
               <p>I find, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.2. That the Apoſtle tells us, that in the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> were the <hi>Candleſtick,</hi> the <hi>Table,</hi> and the <hi>Shew-bread:</hi> But can this <hi>Gentleman</hi> make it evidently appear to us what theſe were Types of? He may gueſs, it may be, and offer us a handſome conjecture in the caſe, but he cannot make it appear clearly and convincingly to us, what theſe things were ſhadows of. And may we thence be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to argue, that theſe things were not Typical of ſomething fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo no part of the Ceremonial Law? I ſuppoſe not.</p>
               <p>The generality of <hi>Reformed Divines</hi> have eſteemed theſe Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Inſtruments Typical. What was the thing typified, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by theſe dark ſhadows, is not, I confeſs, ſo eaſie to determine. But yet, I ſuppoſe, a Man may as well diſcover the ſignification of Muſical Inſtruments, as of ſome other of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Types. For we can only Conjecture at the things which were repreſented by many of them.</p>
               <p>The Sylver Trumpets are conceived to hold forth the Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel, and the Publication of the Truths of God by his Sacred Miniſters. And there ſeem to be ſome hints in Scripture to give countenance to this. As when <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.20. <hi>The tongue of the juſt is as choice Silver,</hi> perhaps alluding to the Silver Trumpets. So the Meſſengers of God, are ſaid, <hi>to lift up their voice as a Trumpet, Iſa.</hi> 58.1. So <hi>Hoſea</hi> 8.1. <hi>Set the Trumpet to thy mouth.</hi> And <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.3, 6. The faithful, and execution of their Office is expreſſed by blowing the Trumpet. So when it is ſaid in that great Prophecy concerning the Reſtoration of the Jews, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.13. <hi>In that day the great Trumpet ſhall be blown;</hi> it is underſtood by Expoſitors, of the ſounding of the Silver Trumpet of the Goſpel throughout the World. <hi>Tubae Spiritualis, nempe, Evangelii Clangor,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe, and all the reſt of their Muſical Inſtruments ſeem to have been expreſſive of <hi>joy,</hi> Pſal. 89.15. and 98.6. <hi>Bleſſed is the People that know the joyful ſound. With Harp, with Trumpets, with ſound of Cornet make a joyful noiſe before the Lord the King.</hi> And ſo they were fit Reſemblances to ſhadow out that Heavenly Muſick, and inward Melody of the Joys and Graces of Gods Spirit in the hearts of his

Thus I have ſhewed you how ſome reply to the <hi>Minor</hi> of our Authors Argument.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) But ſome others are of Opinion, that the Conſequence of his <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition may juſtly be called in Queſtion For altho' In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental Muſick was a part of the Ceremonial Law, yet may it be queſtioned whether it will thence neceſſarily follow, that it muſt have been Typical; and to make this good, he muſt prove that all the Rites enjoined the <hi>Jews</hi> by the Ceremonial Law were Typical; which, I believe, will prove to be no eaſie task to him.</p>
               <p>God indulged the <hi>Jews</hi> many pompous Rites to affect their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which were ſuited to their Carnality and Minority, and though ſome Rites in their Worſhip might not be Typical, yet were they peculiar to the <hi>Jewiſh oeconomy,</hi> adapted to the temper of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who were ſtupid and Carnal. Therefore ſome Divines have made a Diſtinction between the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites, ſome of which, they ſay, were Typical, others for the greater Magnificence, and yet both peculiar to the <hi>Jewiſh oeconomy.</hi> Thus<note n="†" place="margin">In <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Junius,</hi> Of <hi>thoſe things which were commanded by the Law, ſome were ſignificative of ſome future thing, others were peculiar to that Church; to make uſe of thoſe things, which were ſignificative of ſomething future after the coming of Chriſt, is impious; and now to uſe thoſe things which were peculiar to that Church, is ridiculous.</hi> Now it is the opinion of many eminent <hi>Divines,</hi> that Muſical Inſtruments, were in the Number of thoſe Rites which were Pompous, and only for the greater Solemnity of their External Worſhip, and ſuited to their Minority, and Infant ſtate. The <hi>Jews</hi> were a People very prone to imitate their Idolatrous Neighbours in their Sacred Rites and Worſhip, and ſo to deſert the Worſhip of the true God.</p>
               <p>Therefore God indulged, and enjoyned them a Pompous Worſhip, with a great <hi>Apparatus</hi> of ſplendid Rites to ſuit their <hi>Carnal Temper,</hi> to prevent their taking up with the Superſtitious Worſhip, and the vain Rites of the <hi>Heath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>And it is proper now in the Chriſtian Church, to ſtir up mens minds, to compoſe their thoughts, and to inflame their Devotion therewith, as it was in the Reign of</hi> David, <hi>and therefore as reaſonable it ſhould be continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer (1.) God has appointed means ſufficient under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel for theſe ends. The word preached, Sacraments adminiſtred, the ſinging of Gods Praiſes with the Voice, and Vocal Prayers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, are deſtined to the ſtirring up of Mens Minds, to the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Mens Thoughts, and the inflaming their Devotions. And there needs not the Supplement of Organs. (2.) God ſuited means then to the Infant State of the Church. And he has ſuited means now to its more grown ſtate, means proper to <hi>inflame Devotion.</hi> (3.) If Inſtrumental Muſick be ſo uſeful now <hi>to ſtir up Mens Minds, &amp;c.</hi> what is the reaſon that the Apoſtles uſed it not? And that there was nothing found of it amongſt the Primitive Chriſtians? What were there none amongſt them, who needed to <hi>have had</hi> their <hi>Affections ſtirred,</hi> their <hi>Thoughts compoſed,</hi> or their <hi>Devotions inflamed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:40568:41"/>Thus, I think, I have fully Vindicated the Argument of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva Annotators</hi> againſt the uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick in Chriſtian Churches, from the Cavils and feeble Aſſaults of Mr. <hi>Newte?</hi> So that their Argument ſtill ſtands in its full force. And it is apparent that Inſtrumental Muſick was a part of the Ceremonial Law (or I would rather ſay, enjoyned by the Ceremonial Law) or of that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Worſhip, which was ſuited to the Carnality and Minority of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and was to have its continuance only till the Meſſiahs Reformation ſet up a better Law and Worſhip. Give me leave to preſent you with a pertinent paſſage of the Learned Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> †,<note n="*" place="margin">His Works. Vol. 2. p. 1060.</note> ſaith he, <hi>Chriſt aboliſhed the Worſhip of the Temple as purely Ceremonious, but he perpetuated the Worſhip of the Synagogue, reading the Scriptures, Praying, Preaching, and Singing of Pſalms, and tranſplanted it into the Chriſtian Church as purely Moral.</hi> Now Inſtrumental Muſick was part of the Temple Service, and peculiarly ſo, and was never uſed in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogues, or in their Parochial Service, and therefore ought to be laid aſide with the other Numerous Rights of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion. And we have no more warrant to recal it into the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> Church, than we have to introduce Incenſe, Lamps, or Silver Trumpets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> But he propounds a ſecond Objection, to which he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe attempts a Reply.<note place="margin">Ser. p. 34.</note> The Objection he ſtates thus. <hi>That Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſick is not ſo edifying in the Chriſtian Church as we plead for, nor ſo proper, where we are not to Worſhip God with external Ceremonies, and the outward formality of ſerving him, as the</hi> Jews <hi>did, but in Spirit and in Truth, and for this reaſon Inſtrumental Muſick ought to be aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Objection thus expreſſed, is, I confeſs, not ſo clear as I could wiſh it. What many of our Divines againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> aſſert is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are to Worſhip God <hi>in Spirit and Truth,</hi> without a Multiplicity of Pompous Rites and Gaudy Ceremonies, which God has not Inſtituted; which are adapted to pleaſe the Senſes, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to Edifie the Minds of Men. They may gratifie a vain Fancy, but they are not ſuited to the Spiritual Nature of Goſpel Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and are inconſiſtent with its Simplicity. This is ſuppoſed by many to be ſufficient ground to exclude Inſtrumental Muſick out of <hi>Chriſtian Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our <hi>Author</hi> will confute this. <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>It is no way repugnant to the moſt Spiritul Worſhip whatſoever;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ser. p. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>but ſo far from being prejudicial to it; that it is highly advantagious to make the Chriſtian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the more Spiritual, and to ſtir up the Affections of the Soul in order thereto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:40568:41"/>But to try the ſtrength of this <hi>Anſwer,</hi> (1.) Is Inſtrumental Muſick <hi>no way repugnant to the moſt Spiritual Worſhip whatever?</hi> Many have thought it ſo, and experience has taught them that they have not thought amiſs. For inſtead of heightning the Affections in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, it rather diſtracts the mind, and diverts it from being intent upon the matter ſung. I have been frequently an Auditor to this ſort of Muſick, and I muſt profeſs from experience I have ſadly found it to have had this effect upon me. It has rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted my thoughts, than any thing intended my Devotions. And multitudes have complained of the ſame. (2.) The <hi>Papiſts</hi> will ſay the ſame of their Crucifixes, of their lighted Candles, of their Sacred Relicks, and the other many pompous Rites to be found amongſt them; namely, That they are <hi>no way repugnant to the moſt Spiritual Worſhip whatever;</hi> but that they rather contribute to the rendring the Chriſtian Worſhip the more Spiritual. What is there to be ſaid for an Organ, which a <hi>Papiſt</hi> will not ſay for a Crucifix? Will it be ſaid that an Organ affects the Soul by the Ear? And a <hi>Papiſt</hi> will ſay that a Crucifix will affect the Soul by the Eye. And what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it, by what ſenſe the Soul be affected, ſo it be affected? For my part, I cannot ſee what our Author can ſay in this Caſe for his darling Inſtrument, but what a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> upon as good ground, may ſay for his Crucifix.</p>
               <p>But to recommend his Organ the more, he adds, Inſtrumental Muſick is <hi>highly advantagious to make the Chriſtian Worſhip the more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</hi> But (1.) You muſt pardon me for once, if I take leave to tell you, that I am pretty confident, that this <hi>Author</hi> is the firſt <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> amongſt Reformed <hi>Proteſtants</hi> who has aſſerted this. (2.) If In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental Muſick <hi>will make the Chriſtian Worſhip the more Spiritual,</hi> then will it be the leſs Spiritual without it; and then will it follow, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> Worſhipped God in a leſs Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual manner than do Mr. <hi>Newte</hi> and his Congregation. Which I preſume, will not ſo eaſily gain credit amongſt the thinking part of <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> (3.) This will impeach Chriſt as guilty of an overſight, in that he neglected either of himſelf, or by his Apoſtles to enjoin his Followers the uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick, which is ſo very <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to make the Chriſtian Worſhip the more Spiritual.</hi> If it were ſo exceedingly <hi>advantageous</hi> to Perſons to render <hi>their Worſhip the more Spiritual,</hi> it is ſtrange the New-Teſtament ſhould be ſo utterly ſilent about it. It is ſtrange that nor Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles ſhould have drop'd a word to recommend the uſe of it. (4.) But I hope our Author will prove, that Inſtrumental Muſick is highly <hi>advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to make the Chriſtian Worſhip the more Spiritual,</hi> e're he expects that others ſhould give their aſſent to it. That a few inarticulate ſounds, breaking forth from ſeveral Pipes, ſuited to pleaſe the Ear,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40568:42"/>
and tickle the Fancy, ſhould render the <hi>Chriſtian Worſhip more Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> than otherwiſe it would be, (when as we have no Precept, nor Promiſe to expect any ſuch effect from thence) is certainly a little hard to be believed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ser. p. 35.</note>But our <hi>Author</hi> will enforce what he hath ſaid from experience. <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>The experience of thoſe who have profeſſed ſeriouſly to have received great benefit by it, is a farther Argument to convince us of its uſe.</hi> But (1.) What doth this Author intend by <hi>[convince us of its uſe?]</hi> Does he mean that the Experience of ſome is an Argument to prove that Inſtrumental Muſick has been uſed? I believe this to be true, but then it is nothing to his purpoſe. Or does he intend by <hi>[con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of its uſe]</hi> that others Experience of the benefit they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by it, is an Argument to convince us, that Inſtrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick may lawfully be uſed in the Worſhip of God? Then, ſay I, he might have expreſſed himſelf a little more clearly, if he had pleaſed. (2.) Well then his Argument is this. Some Perſons have ſeriouſly profeſſed to have received great benefit by Inſtrumental Muſick, <hi>Ergo,</hi> The uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick is now lawful in Chriſtian Worſhip. Here I ſhall take leave to proteſt againſt his Conſequence. For that his Argument is inconſequent, I hope will be evident from theſe following Remarks. (1.) The <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> argue at the ſame rate for the uſe of a Crucifix in the Worſhip of God; <hi>For ſome Perſons have ſeriouſly profeſſed to have received great benefit by the</hi> beholding of a Crucifix in time of Divine Worſhip; therefore a Crucifix may lawfully be uſed in the Worſhip of God amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Thus they plead for the uſe of a Crucifix <hi>in Sacris.</hi> Let our Author Anſwer them, and he will Anſwer himſelf. (2.) For ought I know, well-meaning Perſons may in this caſe be ſomewhat mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken. Inſtrumental Muſick may put a brisk, and pleaſing Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon their Spirits (which may be without the excitation of holy thoughts) which may rather divert their minds from the Sacred Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon which they ought to be intent, than keep them fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. So that this may rather prove a fancied benefit, than a real one. (3) Others profeſs that they experience Inſtrumental Muſick to be ſo far from being a help to Devotion, that it diſtracts in it. I have cited many to this purpoſe above, and more might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, if there were any need of their Teſtimony. (4.) Suppoſe it for a Truth, that ſome Perſons may occaſionally have had holy Affections raiſed in the Worſhip of God by this ſort of Muſick, I do not think we may hence juſtly conclude it lawful to introduce it into all Worſhipping Aſſemblies, as a ſtated means to excite holy Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Good Men may have holy Affections occaſionally raiſed in them by many things (as a Deaths head, a Skeleton, a Dead and Bloody Lamb, and ſome have profeſt that they have had holy
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40568:42"/>
Thoughts and Affections ſtirring in them at the view of a Gallows) which yet I preſume our Author will not plead may be lawfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into Divine Worſhip, as a ſtated means to excite holy Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in the Worſhippers. (5.) But how does our Author, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers know that their Affections are excited in the Worſhip of God by Organs? If they experience holy Affections ſtirring in them, I ſhould rather aſcribe it to the Ordinance of Singing, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſung, than to a few inanimate Pipes. For we have reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that God will concur with his own Inſtitutions, but none to preſume, that he will do the like as to Mens Fancies. Theſe things duely weighed, I think the inconſequence of our Authors Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from <hi>Experience</hi> will ſufficiently appear.</p>
               <p>He informs us, that there are <hi>ſome other Objections of leſs note, which ſcarce deſerve a ſerious Anſwer.</hi> One of which he is pleaſed to ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. <hi>For ſome,</hi> he ſays, <hi>object, they do not like it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ser. p. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>and they ſhall never endure it.</hi> But I take leave to aſſure you, that I can ſcarcely believe any Perſons would offer ſuch an Objection. I cannot well conceive, that any ſhould have been ſo very abſurd, as to make their not liking of this Muſick, a Reaſon why they would not like it. What Perſons Mr. <hi>Newte</hi> may have diſcourſed upon this Subject, I know not; but perhaps this Gentleman thought fit to mention this Objection (as he ſtiles it) that he might have an opportunity of Adorning his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with an excellent paſſage taken out of that Celebrated Book Entituled <hi>Aeſops Fables,</hi> Engliſhed by the Learned,<note place="margin">Ser. p. 35.</note> and Loyal Sir <hi>Roger Le Strange.</hi> But adds our Author, <hi>unleſs Perſons are of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly moroſe, and ill-natured Diſpoſition, ſo harmonious and piercing a thing as Inſtrumental Muſick muſt needs move them to a liking, and a loving of it.</hi> It may be ſo, Perſons may love it as Muſick in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place and ſeaſon, and yet may not like it in the Worſhip of God, as a ſtated means for the exciting of holy Affections in our ſolemn and publick Praiſes of the Almighty.</p>
               <p>But as to thoſe Perſons who appear to be ſo extreamly fond of this kind of Muſick in the Worſhip of God, I wiſh they evidence themſelves to be Men of more Temper, Moderation and Charity, than their Neighbours. I have known thoſe in the late Reigns, (great Admirers of this Muſick in the Worſhip of God, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Auditors of it) who yet have diſcovered as much Rage and and Violence, Paſſion and Peeviſhneſs, as any about them. So that I muſt profeſs to you, that I am not forward to believe that this ſort of Muſick is of ſo mighty an efficacy as to calm Mens ſtormy Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to expel Envy or Malice out of their Breaſts.</p>
               <p>But whereas our Author talks, as if there were no other Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of any conſiderable note againſt the lawfulneſs of the uſe of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans in the Publick Worſhip of God; I can aſſure you he is much
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40568:43"/>
miſtaken. I could direct him to ſome Authors where he might find many of conſiderable weight, which he has taken no notice of. But I will preſume, that altho' he has read ſome Authors, who write for the lawfulneſs of the uſe of Organs in the Sacred Aſſemblies of Chriſtians, yet he has ſcarcely read any, who have written againſt ſuch an uſe of them. For I am ſatisfied, he talks as if he had not. Some Mens Libraries are as Partial as themſelves, and will ſcarcely afford an Author who determines a Queſtion on that ſide they are againſt.</p>
               <p>There are other Arguments of conſiderable ſtrength to be met withal againſt the Lawfulneſs of Organs <hi>in Sacris,</hi> beſide thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by our Author. Be pleaſed to conſult ſome of our <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Writers againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and you will ſoon be ſatisfied as to this. I humbly conceive I have ſuggeſted ſome Objections already, which our Author has not mentioned.</p>
               <p>But let this be a third Objection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. The uſe of Organs in Chriſtian Aſſemblies for Divine Worſhip condemned as unlawful by the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Homilies.</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her <hi>Homilies</hi> agrees with the <hi>Geneva Annotators.</hi> Now that the uſe of Organs in the Worſhip of God is condemned by the <hi>Homilies</hi> is moſt plain. For in the <hi>Homily of the time, and place of Prayers,</hi> Part II. there is this objection ſuppoſed to be made by one who cared not to frequent the Pariſh-Churches, <hi>viz. Alas! What ſhall we do at Church! Since all the Saints are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſince all the goodly ſights we were wont to have are gone? Since we cannot hear the like Piping, Singing, Chaunting, and playing upon the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, that we could before?</hi> To this it is replied. <hi>But, Dearly beloved, we ought greatly to rejoyce, and give God thanks, that our Churches are delivered out of all thoſe things, which diſpleaſed God ſo ſore, and filthily defiled his Houſe, and his place of Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The complaint of the Perſon, who refuſed to frequent the Pariſh Churches was amongſt other things, that <hi>there was no playing on the Organs there.</hi> And to this the Anſwer is, <hi>That we ought to rejoyce, and to give God thanks that the Church was delivered from theſe things which were ſo diſpleaſing to God, and ſo defiling to his Houſe.</hi> This was the Opinion of the <hi>Church of England</hi> in the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> Namely, that Organs in Churches are <hi>diſpleaſing to God, and filthily defiling to his Houſe.</hi> So that in the judgment of our Authors Church, the uſe of Organs in the Worſhip of God is unlawful. Now the <hi>Homilies</hi> and the Doctrine contained in them are approved, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and eſtabliſhed by the Supream Authority of Church and State, <hi>Canons of Convocation, and Acts of Parliament,</hi> as the late

Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> expreſly ordered theſe <hi>Homilies</hi> to be read in the Churches, as you may ſee in the Preface to thoſe <hi>Homilies.</hi> And <hi>Article</hi> 35 doth approve and confirm the Doctrine of the <hi>Homilies</hi> as good and wholeſome. For ſaith that <hi>Article. The Second Book of Homilies, the ſeveral titles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have joined under this Article, doth contain a Godly and wholeſome Doctrine, and neceſſary for theſe times, as doth the former</hi> Book of Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies <hi>which was ſet forth in the time of</hi> Edward VI. <hi>and therefore we judge to be read in Churches by the Miniſters diligently and diſtinctly, as they may be underſtood by the People.</hi> Whence it is apparent the Church approves of thoſe <hi>Homilies.</hi> (1.) As containing a <hi>Godly wholſom Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> (2.) As to the reading of them in the Churches. So that hence I infer, that it is the profeſt Judgment of this Authors Church, that it is a <hi>Godly and wholſome Doctrine;</hi> namely, That <hi>Organs</hi> in Churches <hi>are diſpleaſing to God, and do filthily defile his holy Houſe.</hi> Our Author has ſubſcribed theſe <hi>Articles</hi> of the Church, and ſo has there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by approved of the <hi>Homilies,</hi> and now let him Reconcile his Sermon to the <hi>Homilies</hi> if he can. Had the <hi>Geneva Annotators</hi> ſaid but as much, as do the <hi>Homilies</hi> againſt Organs, O how Tragically would he have exclaimed, as if they meant no leſs than the total Subverſion of the Church; well perhaps by his next we may have him beſtowing the Epithite of <hi>Pernicious</hi> upon the <hi>Homilies</hi> too.</p>

If the Praiſing of God with Organs be thus Lawful in the Worſhip of God, as our Author pleads; then will it, for the ſame reaſon, be lawful to introduce other Muſical Inſtruments into the Worſhip of God, ſuch as Harps, and Trumpets, Pſalteries and Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other Rites too, as Dancing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For upon our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Principles, theſe are lawful to be uſed in the Worſhip of God alſo. And ſo it will be lawful to dreſs up the Chriſtian Worſhip with as much Pomp and Ceremony, as was that of the <hi>Temple,</hi> which I think, none will aſſert, who duely underſtand the Nature of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Worſhip.</p>

For to inſtitute a leſs proper means to raiſe Affections, and excite Devotion, and to neglect the <hi>moſt proper means,</hi> argues a want of Wiſdom. But according to him, Chriſt and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> have neglected to appoint the moſt proper means to <hi>raiſe the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> and excite the <hi>Devotions</hi> of Chriſtians. Therefore in effect his Opinion charges them with a want of Wiſdom. For it is moſt certain, that, altho' our Lord, and his Apoſtles have inſtituted Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Muſick, yet have they not appointed Inſtrumental for the raiſing the Affections of Chriſtians, and quickning their Devotions. And ſo they have neglected to preſcribe the <hi>most proper means</hi> for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of theſe ends in our Authors Judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 6. But to conclude, I would interrogate our Author, were I by him, whether according to the <hi>Act of Uniformity,</hi> and the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> the particular Paſtor of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Church is allowed to introduce new Rites and Modes of Worſhip into his Pariſh-Church, over and above what are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Act of Uniformity,</hi> without a Warrant either from a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi> or a <hi>Parliament?</hi> And whether Supra-conformity be not as much a Tranſgreſſion of the <hi>Statute of Uniformity,</hi> as Subter-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity? This Gentleman cannot plead that he has an <hi>Injunction</hi> from the <hi>Kings Majeſty,</hi> nor a Warrant from any <hi>Statute</hi> enacted by <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> nor from any <hi>Canon</hi> of any <hi>Convocation,</hi> nor from any <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick</hi> in the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> for the ſetting up his Organ in his Pariſh-Church. Therefore what has induced him to put his Pariſh to ſo great a charge, I cannot well imagine. Thus, I hope, you are by this time convinced, that ſomewhat more may be ſaid againſt the uſe of Organs <hi>in Sacris,</hi> than what is to be found in our Authors Sermon.</p>
               <p>Thus I have done with the Argumentative part of his <hi>Sermon;</hi> There are a few paſſages towards the concluſion of it, which I would crave leave to make a few Remarks upon, e're I put an end to this Letter.</p>
               <p>He having finiſhed the Argumentative part of his Diſcourſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to entertain his Reader with a Panegyrick upon the Church, and its Service, and I will aſſure you a pretty lofty one too. <q>Take the whole Conſtitution of our Church,<note place="margin">Ser. p. 37.</note> 
                     <hi>ſaith he,</hi> as it ſtands, the Envy of our Neighbours, the great Bulwark againſt the Inundations of Hereſie and Schiſme, the Hatred and Fear of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and I hope, the Rock of Ages, and there is no compariſon between this and any other Eſtabliſhment in the Chriſtian World.</q> And preſently upon this he preſents you with a Prayer not to be found in the <hi>Engliſh Liturgy. Againſt which let neither the Malice of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40568:44"/>
Devils, nor the Policy of</hi> Rome, <hi>nor the Craft of</hi> Geneva <hi>be ever able to prevaile, either to overthrow its Strength, thro' a fatal Diviſion among her Members, or to rifle its Beauty thro' a Deluge of Vice, or to undermine her Foundation by a treacherous Comprehenſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) He ſaith, he hopes this Church is the <hi>Rock of Ages.</hi> The Supream Governour of the Church is ſo Stiled, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.4. But I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before read any Church on Earth ſo called; and methinks it is a little too lofty for the beſt Eccleſiaſtical Society on Earth.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) What does he mean by the <hi>whole Conſtitution as it ſtands?</hi> What! Does he intend the <hi>Arch-Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> Courts, with the many Lay-Officers appertaining to them? Does he intend the Singing-Men and Singing Boys? Does he intend the Un-ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Rites and Ceremonies, the uſe of which are enjoyned by the Church; ſuch as kneeling at the Reception of the Elements at the Lord's Supper; the Croſs in Baptiſm; the Surplice, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Does he intend the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> impoſed upon all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters as to the uſe of it? Does he intend <hi>Deans, Arch-Deacons, Canons,</hi> a ſort of Officers utter Strangers to the <hi>Primo</hi>-Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians? Does he intend Pluralities, and Non-reſidence? And the reading ſome part of the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> for Leſſons, to the excluding ſome part of the Scriptures from being read in Churches? And does he intend the uſe of Organs in Churches too? Are theſe any part of the <hi>Constitution</hi> as it ſtands? And if they are, are theſe ſuch mighty Bulwarks againſt Hereſie and Schiſm? Are theſe the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and the Fear of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> No, thoſe things in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which are the Hatred and Fear of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are the Doctrines, and Worſhip, and Scriptural Diſcipline, in which the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth fully agree with the ſober Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Diſſenters. The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> neither fears nor hates Dioceſan Biſhops as ſuch, for ſhe has them; nor Un-ſcriptural Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, for ſhe has a world of theſe; nor of Arch-Deacons and Canons, and other ſuch Un-ſcriptural Officers, for ſhe has them. Nor of Singing-Men, or Singing-Boys, for her Churches ring with them; nor of a Liturgy as ſuch, for ſhe has one; nor of Organs for they are frequently found in her Temples; nor of Croſſes for ſhe abounds with them.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) But this <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>is a Bulwark againſt the inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Hereſie and Schiſme.</hi> Officers which Chriſt ne're appointed, Modes of Worſhip which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ne're Inſtituted, which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and Chriſtians of the pureſt Ages ne're practiſed, are not ſuch a Bulwark; Therefore, if any ſuch things are to be found in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this <hi>Authors</hi> Church, they are not <hi>Bulwarks againſt Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and Schiſm.</hi> So excellent a Conſtitution as is that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> does not utterly prevent all Hereſie and Schiſm: For
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40568:45"/>
that there are many Hereticks in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is, I think, too apparent to admit of a denial. Many Books and Pamphlets have of late been written by the <hi>Unitarians</hi> (as they term themſelves) againſt the Doctrines of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Incarnation, &amp;c.</hi> But have theſe been written by Perſons of the <hi>Presbiterian,</hi> or <hi>Congregational</hi> Perſwaſion? No, but the <hi>Authors</hi> of thoſe Books and Pamphlets de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves to be Members of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I would only refer you to Mr. <hi>Edward</hi>'s <hi>Socinian Creed,</hi> p. 182, 183. Where you may find plain evidence for this. It would be tedious to Tranſcribe what he ſaith, I would rather you ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe that <hi>Treatiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſide you find not ſo many (if any at all) of theſe Hereticks in the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> have the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government eſtabliſhed amongſt them, yet few or none of the <hi>Racovian Gentlemen</hi> are found to enfeſt them. Whether this may be owing to their Conſtitution, or no, I ſhall not determine. Yet if this of preventing Hereſie may be thought a good Argument of the excellency of any Eccleſiaſtical Eſtabliſhment, ſome may be tempted to think the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Conſtitution to be preferable to that of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>But as to <hi>Schiſm,</hi> How does the Conſtitution of our Authors Church prevent Schiſm? Are there not many <hi>Non-Jurors</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites</hi> in the Eſtabliſhed Church? And are not they Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks? Has not a Doctor of the Church lately attempted to prove them ſo?</p>
               <p>But to be ſhort, That which is the Bulwark in the Church of <hi>England</hi> againſt Hereſie, and is its Glory, are the Excellent Doctrines which ſhe maintains, and adheres to in common with ſober Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> are the holy Lives of many of her Members, and the great Learning and Zeal of ſome of her <hi>Clergy,</hi> who really believe the Doctrinal Articles<note n="*" place="margin">And ſuch look upon the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles not to be Articles of <hi>Peace</hi> only, but Articles of <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </note> they have Subſcribed, and are both able, and forward to defend them againſt the Aſſaults of Cavelling <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> or Noiſy <hi>Infidels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Gentleman</hi> ranks <hi>Geneva</hi> with <hi>Rome,</hi> and begs that the Church may be ſecured from the Craft of the one, as well as from the Policy of the other. <hi>Geneva</hi> is at a very great diſtance from <hi>England,</hi> therefore I cannot imagine the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be in any danger from that Quarter. Had he prayed that the Church might be delivered from the Doctrines and Deſigns of <hi>Cracovians</hi> and <hi>Deists,</hi> for ought I know, it might have been ſomewhat more to purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But in ſome Mens Opinion nothing more dangerous than <hi>Geneva.</hi> And we know who have ſaid, that they had rather be <hi>Papiſts,</hi> than <hi>Presbiterians.</hi> That is, they had rather be Idolaters, and Slaves to <hi>Rome,</hi> than be <hi>Reformed Proteſtants.</hi> But from whence our Author
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40568:45"/>
borrowed this Cant about <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> it is not difficult to gueſs; for it was a uſual ſaying of a great and admired Prelate, A. B. L. <hi>Eccleſia Romana, &amp; Turba Genevenſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But another Petition in our Authors Prayer, compoſed for his own uſe (for it is his <hi>Noſtrum</hi>) is, <hi>That the Foundation of the Church may not be undermined by a treacherous Comprehenſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Should there be ſuch a Comprehenſion as would take in <hi>Atheiſts, Deiſts</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> into the Church, it would really be a <hi>Treacherous Comprehenſion,</hi> and tend directly to the Churches Subverſion. But if ſober Proteſtant <hi>Diſſenters</hi> (who are ſound as to the Doctrines they believe, Lovers of Morality, and of a good Life; tho' ſomewhat differing, in their Apprehenſions as to leſs concerning matters, from thoſe of the National Eſtabliſhment) ſhould be comprehended, ſuch a <hi>Comprehenſion</hi> would be far enough from undermining the Churches Foundation, and would diſclaim the Epithet of <hi>Treacherous.</hi> The Church would be the more enlarged and ſtrengthened by it; and it would more conduce to her Glory, her Beauty, and her laſting Tranquility, than a Hundred pair of Organs. The <hi>Proteſtant Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> e're now have been thought of uſe to help to give a Check to the Growth of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Faction amongſt us. And they are always ready to be helpful in that kind. They would not undermine or betray the Church, but do their utmoſt to ſtrengthen and defend it. <hi>It ought not to trouble us,</hi> ſaith Dr. <hi>Goodman,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Sermons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 244.</note> 
                  <hi>that ſome Men</hi> (i. e. Proteſtant Diſſenters) <hi>ſhould enjoy ſomeſhare of Advantage by this Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, ſince it is not only what we vowed to God, and promiſed to them in our Adverſity, but is that which cannot be denyed them conſiſtently with our own ſafety.</hi> And why ſhould they not have an Advantage ſo great as that of a Comprehenſion amounts to? Were there many more Perſons of ſound Doctrine, of peaceable Tempers, of Holy Converſations admitted into the Church, would ſhe be the worſe for it? Would it be Treachery to admit ſuch for her Members? I am ſatisfied our Author will never be able to prove it ſo. If Perſons are ſound as to their Doctrines, unblameable as to their Lives, and promiſe to live peaceably under the Government, and to endeavour in their Capacities its ſupport, Why ſhould they be kept out of the Church, for their ſuſpecting ſome Un-ſcriptural Terms of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to be unlawful? I have read ſome Interrogatories in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Worceſters Irenicum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In the Preface,</note> which I never yet met with a fair Reply to. I wiſh our Author would allow them a ſerious peruſal. Saith that <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Reverend Prelate.</hi> 
                  <q>What poſſible Reaſon can be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned or given, why ſuch things ſhould not be ſufficient for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with a Church, which are ſufficient for eternal Salvation? what ground can there be, why Chriſtians ſhould not ſtand upon the ſame Terms now, which they did in the times of Chriſt and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40568:46"/>
his Apoſtles? Was not Religion ſufficiently guarded and fenced in then? Was there ever more and Cordial Reverence in the Worſhip of God? What Charter hath Chriſt given the Church to bind Men up to more than himſelf hath done? Or to exclude thoſe from her Society, who may be admitted into Heaven? Will Chriſt ever thank Men at the great Day, for keeping out ſuch from Communion with his Church, whom he will vouchſafe not only Crowns of Glory to, but it may be <hi>Aure ole</hi> too, if there be any ſuch thing there? The grand Commiſſion the Apoſtles were ſent out with, was only to teach what Chriſt had commanded them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> I wiſh our Author would calmly conſider theſe things. But our Author extreamly dreads any thing of an alteration in his Church. <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>every alteration in ſo well ordered a Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will be for the worſe, and give too great an occaſion for the Triumph of her Enemies, who would be glad to have her honour laid in the duſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Will every alteration in ſo well-ordered a Conſtitution be for the worſe?</hi> Then the introducing of Organs into the Worſhip of God in Pariſh Churches will be for the <hi>worſe,</hi> for it is no part of this <hi>Conſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) But I am not of this Gentlemans Opinion, that <hi>every Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Conſtitution</hi> of the National Church <hi>will be for the worſe.</hi> I humbly conceive ſome alteration may be made for the better. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Croſs in Baptiſm, the Surplice, and Kneeling at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament were left indifferent as to uſe, as they are pretended to be in their own Nature? Would not this be better than to make them neceſſary conditions of Communion with the Church; by which many Perſons of eminent Piety are excluded the Church, who would otherwiſe be admitted into it? Theſe little things (as they are eſteemed by the Impoſers themſelves) occaſion great Heats and Contentions, and fruitleſs Controverſies, which would ſoon have a period upon the leaving theſe things indifferent. What if ſome exceptionable paſſages in the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> were altered, or expunged? As the <hi>Rubrick</hi> concerning Baptiſm, <hi>viz. It is certain by Gods Word, that Children which are Baptized, dying before they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit actual Sin, are undoubtedly ſaved;</hi> And thoſe words uſed at the Interment of all Perſons tho' never ſo Lewd and Vicious, <hi>viz.

What if ſome <hi>Chapters</hi> of the <hi>Canonical</hi> Books were appointed to be read in the room of the <hi>Apochriphal</hi> Leſſons? What if one, or both of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were admitted to undertake for their own Children at Baptiſm, to the laying by of <hi>God-fathers and God-Mothers?</hi> What if the <hi>Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Authority</hi> was taken out of the hands of the <hi>Lay-Chancellors,</hi> and excerciſed only by the <hi>Clergy?</hi> What if Perſons, (ſuppoſing they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40568:46"/>
were qualified for the Miniſtry by a Competent Knowledge, by ſoundneſs of Doctrine, an unblameable Life, and by giving ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Government of their <hi>Peaceableneſs</hi> and <hi>Loyalty</hi>) were admitted to the Miniſterial Function, and the Exerciſe of it, without giving their Aſſent, and Conſent to all things contained in the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or Book of <hi>Common-Prayer?</hi> Suppoſe theſe, and ſome ſuch other alterations were made, would it be for the worſe? I am ſatisfied they would not, and our Author will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to prove they would be prejudicial, or detrimental to the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.)

I am prone to believe, that few Perſons, who impartially conſider the ſtate of our Caſe in this Nation, but will be forward to conclude, that there is nothing which the real Enemies of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſo much dread, as a taking of the <hi>Sober Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> into the Boſom of the Church.</p>
               <p>The Churches <hi>Enemies,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>would be glad to have her Honour laid in the Duſt.</hi> Then I am ſatisfied that the <hi>Moderate Diſſenters</hi> are no Enemies to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> For they are not willing that <hi>her Honour ſhould be laid in the Duſt,</hi> but rather deſire that her <hi>real Honour</hi> ſhould be ſecured, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</p>
               <p>He has a very tart Reflection or two upon the <hi>French Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> who have betaken themſelves hither for ſhelter from the dreadful ſtorm of Perſecution in <hi>France.</hi> His concluding paſſage to them is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is certainly too juſt a Reflection upon the integrity of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Refugees, to partake of the protection of the Church,</hi>

                  <hi>without obeying the Laws of her Communion.

Methinks this <hi>Gentleman</hi>'s Muſick might have inſpired him with ſo much Charity, as to have reſtrained him from ſuch Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Reflections as theſe. Why muſt theſe poor Perſecuted Souls be made the Objects of his Spleen? Is this his Charity to laſh the miſerable, who by fiery, <hi>Popiſh,</hi> Perſecuting Zeal are forced from their Native Country, their Houſes, and Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? Did any of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ever diſcover ſuch a Temper? The <hi>French King</hi> has driven them out of his Territories for the Worſhipping of God according to their Conſciences; and muſt the ſame thing here be made a crime by <hi>Proteſtants?</hi> For this muſt their integrity be queſtioned? It is really hard, very hard, that poor perſecuted Souls, who have ſuffered ſo much for Worſhipping God according to the Convictions of their own Minds, from a <hi>Popiſh Party,</hi> ſhould yet be condemned for the ſame by <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Proteſtants.</hi> The <hi>Proteſtant Refugees</hi> Worſhip God in a way they were trained up in, in their own Country, they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded it is a way agreeable to the Word of God; nay, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to it as any other way of Worſhip they meet withal in the World; and therefore they ſee no reaſon to deſert their own way of Worſhip, for one they are not ſo well ſatisfied in. I remember that the Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Sarum</hi> in the Preface to his Tranſlation of <hi>Lactantius</hi>'s <hi>Relation of the Death of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Perſecutors,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 17, 18.</note> ſpeaks to this purpoſe. <hi>It is an Eſſential right of Humane Nature to Worſhip God according to our Conviction, which is in us Antecedent to all Humane Government, and can never become ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Whereas he ſaith, <hi>Is is a juſt Reflection upon the integrity of theſe Proteſtant</hi> Refugees <hi>to partake of the protection of the Church without the obeying the Laws of her Communion;</hi> I rather think it to be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of their great Integrity, that they ſtill adhere to their own way of Worſhipping God (which they judge to be beſt) although they expoſe themſelves to the frowns of the <hi>Clergy</hi> of our Author's Church, and thereby they are debarred from having a ſhare in his Churches Charity. I have, not long ſince, met with ſome Letters Written by ſome of theſe deſpiſed <hi>Refugees</hi> reſiding in <hi>Germany,</hi> Printed in the Year 1690. In which there is one Letter directed to the <hi>Arch-Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Letter 5. p. 34.</note> In which they thus fairly and candidly declare their Sentiments to their <hi>Lordſhips, viz. If</hi> Epiſcopacy <hi>is of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, it follows from hence, that neither the Churches of</hi> France, <hi>nor thoſe of</hi> Holland, <hi>nor thoſe of</hi> Germany, <hi>nor thoſe of</hi> Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>nor</hi> Geneva, &amp;c. <hi>have truely had either Ministers or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſince the Reformation. And would you, My Lords, ſhut up
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40568:47"/>
the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and the Sacraments of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>in the Church of</hi> England <hi>only?</hi> And a little after they add. <hi>If you Renounce this Opinion, that</hi> Epiſcopacy <hi>is of Divine rite, you muſt at the ſame time revoke the Cuſtom of Reordination, which is but a dependance upon it. You cannot imagine how many good Souls find themſelves ſcandalized at this cuſtom, that has been chiefly a very great trouble to the</hi> French Miniſters, <hi>who are diſperſed every where, to be obliged to receive a ſecond Ordination from your Hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are able to execute their Office in the Church of</hi> England; <hi>For we muſt ſincerely tell you, that we know many Perſons, whom this very conſideration hath diſſwaded to retire into</hi> England. I wiſh our Author would conſider this complaint of the <hi>French Proteſtants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Suppoſe this <hi>Gentleman</hi> had lived in the <hi>Marian</hi> days, and had for his ſecurity, been forced to retire into ſome Foreign Proteſtant Country, as <hi>Geneva, Switzerland,</hi> &amp;c. would he not have thought it hard Meaſure, if Proteſtants there ſhould have made tart Reflections upon him for his not approving of, and complying with their Diſcipline in all things? Would he have liked it, if any of them ſhould have blamed him, for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of God according to the Convictions of his own Mind? As the Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Sarum</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Preface before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. p. 16.</note> well ſaith, <hi>No Man has that Superiority over any other Mans Reaſon, as to expect that it ſhould always accomodate its ſelf to his.</hi> And ſaith the ſame <hi>Reverend Prelate</hi> in another place, <hi>There is a Tyranny in moſt mens nature, which makes them deſire to ſubdue all others by the ſtrength of their Underſtandings:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Id. p. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>And ſuch Men have an implacable hatred to all that do not render themſelves to their Reaſons; and think that they are affronted, when other Men refuſe to ſubmit to them: So that he who would ſtrike at</hi> Perſecution <hi>in its root, muſt begin here, and endeavour to ſoften Men, eſpecially towards thoſe who differ from them in matters of Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I wiſh this <hi>Gentlemans</hi> rare Muſick had ſoftened his Spirit a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more toward the Proteſtant <hi>Refugees,</hi> who ſomewhat differ in apprehenſion from him.</p>
               <p>But, I think, I need ſay no more in Vindication of theſe diſtreſſed Proteſtants, than what has been ſaid heretofore by a Doctor of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kanthorp</hi> Defenſio Eccleſiae Anglicanae p. 254.</note> againſt the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Spalato,</hi> a great Papiſt. <q>The Arch-Biſhop I remember objects Churches at <hi>London</hi> are open by Royal Conceſſion to the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Italians:</hi> but all theſe are infected with the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom of <hi>Calvaniſm,</hi> and by theſe <hi>Puritaniſm</hi> is cheriſhed and promoted in <hi>England.</hi> Theſe abominate the Profeſſion and Rites
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40568:48"/>
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </q> To which the <hi>Reverend Doctor</hi> thus replies in the behalf of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Fuiſſe Scimus, &amp; gratiſſimis animis,</hi> &amp;c. We gratefully remember, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that in the times of the <hi>Marian</hi> Perſecution, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> experienced the ſame Offices of Humanity and Piety abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly done her by the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Churches, and thoſe of <hi>Geneva.</hi> We now truly pity their condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by you, and your Cruelty they are become Exiles. And we extreamly rejoyce that our <hi>England</hi> can now be a ſafe Port, and a Sanctuary to them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But then, as to that part of the Objection in which the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> ſaith, that the Foreign Proteſtants <hi>abominate the Profeſſion and Rites of the Church of</hi> England, the Doctor Anſwers thus. <q>In Doctrine, and the profeſſion of the Orthodox Faith there is no diſagreement between us; this being intire, ſome difference as to Rites, and Diſcipline is to be allowed of on both ſides. The raſhneſs of your <hi>Victor</hi> all pious and prudent Perſons have heretofore condemned,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Euſeb.</hi> l. 5. c. 23.</note> and ſtill condemn. <hi>He would force thoſe from Communion, who differed from him in certain Rites.</hi> Nor <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> nor <hi>Policarp,</hi> nor your very Popes themſelves, of a more ſound judgment, as <hi>Amicetus, Pius, Higinus, Teleſphorus, Sixtus,</hi> were of this Temper. They obſerved their own Rite, and manner of Faſting; yet they maintained Peace with others, who came to them from other Churches, although they faſted in a contrary way and manner.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And then he concludes all with this Remark. <q>
                     <hi>Nec tibi, tuiſque Sanguine Sanctorum Ebriis, &amp;c.</hi> Neither does it ſufficiently ſatisfie you and yours, who are drunk with the blood of the Saints, that our Brethren,<note place="margin">p. 255.</note> baniſhed their Country, and ſtript of their Fortunes by your Tyranny, ſhould be Exiles, and Miſerable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, but you would not have them to be, or to behold the Light. You would not have any place in the World for them to ſet their feet upon. This is pleaſing to you, in this the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Beaſt does Exult and Triumph.</q>
               </p>
               <q>Hoc Ithacus velit, &amp; magno mercentur Atridae.</q>
               <p>The Reverend and Charitable <hi>Doctor</hi> knew how to pity the poor diſtreſſed and baniſhed Proteſtants. He condemned them not for their Diſſent from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but he applauds the Churches Charity in maintaining and ſupporting them. So there be but an accord in Doctrine, he is willing that ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in Rites and Diſcipline ſhould be allowed. He reflects not
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40568:48"/>
upon their <hi>Integrity,</hi> becauſe of their Deſcent. But I find Mr. <hi>Newte</hi> is quite of another <hi>Genius.</hi> Well, If the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants among us live quietly and peaceably under the Civil Government, if they are Religious towards God, Righteous towards Men, and of Sober Converſations, why ſhould any Perſons be diſpleaſed with them for the obſervation of their own Eccleſiaſtick Rites and Diſcipline? Is the Church of <hi>England</hi> any thing the worſe for it? Does it hereby ſuffer any diminution in its Revenue? Are not her Dignities ſtill the ſame? And may not the Sons of the Church be as Holy and Devout, as if we had none of theſe People among us? Mr. <hi>Newte</hi> quietly enjoys his own freedom, and Worſhips God in the way be beſt approves of, and let him not be diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that others do ſo too. He has no warrant to make his own Sentiments a ſtandard for Others.</p>
               <p>But, he ſaith, <hi>They are too like the Vipers Brood,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ser. p. 38.</note> 
                  <hi>who eat out the Bowels of their Mother that nouriſheth them up, and maintains them with Ability to ſupport themſelves.</hi> If Vipers deſtroy their Mother, it is but one Viper deſtroys another. But I hope the Proteſtant Refugees are not Vipers, nor the Church of <hi>England</hi> a Viparous Mother. But I cannot underſtand how the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the Mother of the <hi>French Proteſtants,</hi> for they were not born of her; they are of another diſtinct Family. They are got into <hi>England</hi> for ſhelter for a time, and why ſhould not the Church be very kind to her Siſters Children in diſtreſs, notwithſtanding ſome few differences as to External Diſcipline, for theſe are no other than what they derived from their own Parent. And Mr. <hi>Newte</hi>'s Children (if he has any) may as wiſely quarrel with the Children of another Man, for not being like their Father, as he may blame the <hi>French Proteſtants</hi> for ſome little accidental Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in opinion from his Mother the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I do not ſee why this Author and his Church ſhould not patiently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate ſome ſmaller differences in matters of Religion, in the <hi>French Refugees</hi> without offence. Beſide, I would have this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to conſider, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant Diſſenters do large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contribute toward the Maintenance of theſe Proteſtant Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gees, as well as the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how does it appear that the <hi>French Proteſtants</hi> do deſtroy the Church of <hi>England?</hi> I never heard of any one ſtep they have made towards it. This is a ſuggeſtion too black and malevolent, to ſpring from Chriſtian Charity.</p>
               <p>He charges ſome with <hi>Pretending to Preach and Pray by the Spirits</hi> extraordinary Aſſiſtance. Who they are he reflects on,<note place="margin">Ser. p. 43.</note> I know not; For beſide the <hi>Quakers,</hi> I think none pretend to Preach and Pray by the immediate Aſſiſtance of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:40568:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>Thus, Sir, I have given you my thoughts of Mr. <hi>Newte</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. But I fear by this time I have almoſt tired you. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Review of what I have written you, I find that I am chargeable with two faults, the one is the frequent Repetition of the ſame things, the other the prolixity of this Letter. As to the firſt of theſe, I have this to ſay in my juſtification, that I was drawn ſometimes to ſay the ſame thing over again, becauſe the Author of the Sermon abounds ſo much in Repetition. So that the Fault is rather his than mine.
